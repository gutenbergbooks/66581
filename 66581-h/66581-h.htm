<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE QUEEN'S SHILLING.
</h3>

<p>
Robert Wodrow, we have stated, had
disappeared from his home.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor had apparently passed out of his
life, and he felt as if he had nothing more
to hope for in it; but the influence of her
memory hung over him still.
</p>

<p>
Even the love he bore his poor old
mother failed to restrain his wild impulse,
his craving, to begone, he cared not where;
thus her influence also failed in getting
him to resume those medical studies which
he once pursued with enthusiasm, but now
relinquished with indifference or disgust;
and, under the disappointment and mental
worry produced by Ellinor's falsehood to
himself, he failed to graduate at the
expected time.
</p>

<p>
'My poor boy!' his mother said again
and again, while stroking his dark brown
hair caressingly with her now shrivelled
hand; 'that cold-blooded girl has come
between you and your wits.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't call her so, mother.  Perhaps I
did not deserve her,' said he, humbly.
</p>

<p>
'I used to sit and watch you both when
children many a time and oft, and think
what a winsome couple you would be in
the days to come.  Ah me, Robert, your
one ewe lamb, and that stranger took it
from you, to be but a plaything for his
idle hours too probably!'
</p>

<p>
'Mother, you torture me by all this kind
of thing!' exclaimed Robert.
</p>

<p>
'It is perhaps but a sudden girlish fancy
hers for that man Sleath.  It may pass
away and all yet be well.'
</p>

<p>
'Never for me, mother.  And you think
so meanly of me as to take that view of
the matter?  I would not and could not
with my knowledge of the present seek to
have the past over again, and never more
can I look upon Ellinor Wellwood or think
of her save as I would of the dead.  The
charm is broken, the flower has lost its
fragrance, and the peach its bloom.'
</p>

<p>
'Why should the weakness or falsehood
of one person&mdash;one person only&mdash;wreck
the whole life of another?' asked his father,
with some asperity.  'It should not be
so.'
</p>

<p>
'The old and the young view these
matters differently, father,' said Robert,
gently.
</p>

<p>
'True.  I have read that "in youth grief
is a tempest which makes you ill; in old
age it is only like a cold wind which adds
a wrinkle to your face and one more white
lock to the others.  Yet there are people
who can feed themselves on their grief till
they grow fat on it."'
</p>

<p>
But arguments proved unavailing.  The
vicinity of Birkwoodbrae had become
intolerable to Robert now, and he resolved
that he would go far away from them and
the pleasant birks of Invermay; and he
openly announced his intention of becoming
a soldier, adding that nothing would
make him swerve from his purpose, as by
that means he would be taken to other
scenes and be under other influences.
</p>

<p>
'Most evil ones, I fear!' exclaimed the
doctor, striking his hands together.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my poor infatuated boy!' added his
mother, while her tears fell hotly and fast,
and his father started from the table on
which the untasted dinner was spread, tore
open his waistcoat as if he was suffocating,
and paced about the room with impatient
strides, his whole form agitated with a
kind of convulsive agony that cut Robert
to the soul, but did not make him swerve
from his bitter purpose.
</p>

<p>
'Consider the society and profligacy you
have to encounter&mdash;yea, such as even our
ancestor, in the third volume of his <i>Analecta</i>,
details when describing the schools of
profanity in 1726.'
</p>

<p>
Then, after a time, finding that all his
opposition was vain, he said, in a very
broken voice,
</p>

<p>
'God bless and protect you, Robert, and
may He forgive you for all the sorrow you
are causing us, as by such a course you
will be lost to us and to yourself, after all
our care and affection, after all your
painful anxieties at college, and after all your
good training and religious education.'
</p>

<p>
'In three years I shall be an officer,'
exclaimed Robert, confidently, 'and won't
you and the dear old mother be proud of
me then?'
</p>

<p>
But the minister shook his silver head.
</p>

<p>
'Your future&mdash;&mdash;' he began, and paused.
'Who can see the future?'
</p>

<p>
'One above, Robert.  And may He give
you the grace to think overall this terrible
purpose again.'
</p>

<p>
Robert did think again, as he had
thought before, deeply and decidedly, and,
to avoid more painful scenes and partings,
he quitted his bed next morning while the
sky was dark, and no ray of light gilded
as yet the Ochil peaks.  He dressed himself
in haste, took a few necessaries in a
handbag, and after kneeling softly and
saying a prayer at the door of the room in
which his parents were asleep, he tore
himself as it were out of the house and set
forth on his new path in life, the path by
which there might be no returning.
</p>

<p>
In that time of supreme bitterness little
could the poor fellow see all that was
before him.
</p>

<p>
The morning was still dark, but the sky
was clear and starry; the great hills and
tall silver birches in the foreground stood
blackly up against it, and he could hear
that sound so familiar to his ears&mdash;the
rush of the May over its rocky bed.
</p>

<p>
He gave a lingering farewell glance at
the roof of the old house which had been
his home since first he saw the light
there&mdash;the abode, with all its old-fashioned but
substantial furniture, to which his mother
had come a smiling and blushing bride in
the past time&mdash;the abode, till now, of so
much peace, frugality, and happiness&mdash;and
with a bitter sigh he turned his eyes
resolutely away.
</p>

<p>
Then, if aught was required to nerve
him, it was the next feature in the still
and sombre landscape; the smokeless
chimneys and darkened windows of
Birkwoodbrae&mdash;the now empty shrine where
so long his idol had been.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, all I have ever loved!' he exclaimed,
and, wringing his hands, set out
with all speed upon his way, haunted,
however, by the coming grief of those he
was leaving behind when his place was
found empty; when his mother's eyes
would have a vacant chair to contemplate
and his father's reverend head was bent
with sorrow, as it would be in the
separation that was to come; and what is
separation to the loving but a living death?
</p>

<p>
The next day found him among the
wide and stately streets of the Modern
Athens, willing to enlist in the first
regiment any member of which came in his
way, for he was drawing a chance in the
lottery of life now, and to him all
regiments were alike; so, as Fortune had it,
he met a hussar, to whom he expressed his
wishes, and from whom he soon receiyed,
with all due formality, that magic coin <i>the
Queen's Shilling</i>, and became what is termed
'a Headquarter Recruit,' enlisting for 'short
service'&mdash;i.e., six years with the colours.
</p>

<p>
Six years!  In these days of steam the
progress of events is so rapid, what might
not happen in that brief space?
</p>

<p>
He had answered all the usual questions
by those entitled to make them as to his
age, name, parish, and calling, with others
that were less pleasant, as to whether he
had ever served before, or been marked
D. or B.C.; this formality over, and oath
of attestation taken before a bailie of the
city&mdash;the oath to 'be faithful and bear
true allegiance to Her Majesty, her heirs
and successors; obey all orders of Her
Majesty, her heirs and successors; and of
all the generals and officers, &amp;c.,' set over
him&mdash;being concluded, a night intervening
between enlistment and attestation, nothing
remained, as his new friend, Sam Surcingle,
said, 'but to have a drink over it.'
</p>

<p>
This opinion was concurred in by
several smart but long-legged fellows in
braided trousers, and tight jackets, with
caps like scarlet muffins, jangling
jack-spurs, and riding switches, who seemed all
opportunely at hand, and suffering from
chronic thirst, all the more so as the new
recruit seemed to have some loose cash;
and a suitable tavern (the 'Scots Grey')
being at hand, Robert Wodrow soon found
himself acting as host to a military circle
which made up in heedless jollity and
noise what it might lack in rank and
distinction.
</p>

<p>
Yet among the half-dozen or so of his
new friends were, at least, two of those
ill-starred fellows so frequently to be
found in our cavalry regiments at all
times, but more especially just now, those
who by extravagance and dissipation or
failing to achieve the insane 'cramming'
of the present day, had lost their chance
of commissions, and taken 'the shilling'
from sheer love of the service, and the
desperate hope of rising in it.
</p>

<p>
One of these was a mere youth, who,
as Sam Surcingle said, 'had a long
pedigree behind and a long minority before
him;' the other, Toby Chase, the heir to
an ancient baronetcy, was older, and
drank fast to drown care, shouting, with a
laugh,
</p>

<p>
'To-day&mdash;to-day is for me; to-morrow
is the paradise of the fool!  Your health
and promotion, Wodrow, old fellow!'
</p>

<p>
Glass succeeded glass; toasts and
anecdotes&mdash;some of the latter not very
classical&mdash;followed each other fast, till the
sharp trumpets blew 'the last post' in the
adjoining barrack square of Piershill, and
the hussars had to hurry to quarters, and
we are sorry to admit that for perhaps
the first time in his life&mdash;even during
his college career&mdash;Robert Wodrow had
contrived to get disreputably tipsy.
</p>

<p>
He had no care for the present and no
anticipation of the headache and shame
of the morrow, with the disgusts of the
rough riding and 'barrack fatigue,' such
as carrying coals or refilling mattresses
with fresh straw; neither was he troubled
with the natural reflection of what would
be the emotions of his highly-principled
and purely-minded old father and mother
could they have seen him then, when he
had spent the last of his cash on his new
comrades, and was voted the king of good
fellows, and with one of the before-mentioned
scarlet muffins on his head, but
cocked very much over the right ear, he
flourished a riding-whip, while joining, but
with a somewhat 'feathery' voice, in the
song,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'How happy's the soldier that lives on his pay,<br />
  And spends half-a-crown out of sixpence a day!<br />
  Little cares he for the bailiff or bum,<br />
  When he pays all his debts with a roll on the drum.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And so, for a time, Robert Wodrow
passes out of our story; but a time only.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
IN LONDON.
</h3>

<p>
Ellinor was thinking of Redmond
Sleath&mdash;when was she not thinking of
him!&mdash;during all that long, long journey from
the North to London, and Mary had been
painfully struck by her alternate nervous
anxiety and dull, mechanical acceptance of
her own attentions and care during its
progress.  She seemed at times like a
somnambulist&mdash;one moving in her sleep
rather than one to whom the journey
should have been an excitement and a
novelty after the long years of quiet and
seclusion at Birkwoodbrae, hence the strain
upon her overwrought nerves was ere long
to bring a serious illness upon her.
</p>

<p>
A cab&mdash;a genuine London cab, one of
those clumsy four-wheeled 'growlers,'
peculiar to the modern Babylon and to no
other place&mdash;cramped, damp, frowsy, far
from sweet-smelling, and sorely perilous
for ladies' dresses&mdash;had conveyed the
sisters, both feeling somewhat scared and
disconsolate, from the Northern Railway
to the classic region of Paddington by
day, and luckily for them not by night.
</p>

<p>
The long drive westward by the Euston
and Mary-le-Bone Roads had seemed
apparently interminable, and most weary
after a long journey by rail; and then the
architecture, construction, and material of
the houses&mdash;brick, always and for ever
brick&mdash;looked strange and foreign to their
eyes, and so ere long they reached the
Terrace, which adjoins Paddington Church.
They had read of and heard a deal about
the famous old Court suburb of Kensington,
and thought the locality to which a
chance had taken them might prove
something like it.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fubsby, their landlady, whose
address had been given to them by her
nephew, Joe Fubsby, guard of the northern
train (the chance above referred to), and
hence their selection of such a singular
place, received the weary travellers kindly
enough.  She seemed a motherly, well-disposed
woman, but soured in disposition
by past wrongs or sorrows.
</p>

<p>
She was about forty years of age, had
some remains of beauty, and had seen
better days and had other hopes (as usual
with her class), all of which she was not
long in hinting.
</p>

<p>
The sitting-room into which she ushered
them, though scrupulously clean, had a
mouldy odour, suggestive of the adjacent
hideous churchyard; it looked small, poor,
and shabby.  Gaudy artificial flowers in
vases of Derby spar were on the little
mantelpiece, and some highly-coloured
prints in Oxford frames were hung upon
the walls.
</p>

<p>
The air felt close and heavy&mdash;oh, so
heavy, the girls thought, after the fresh,
pure breezes of Invermay!  In fact, there
seemed to be no air at all.
</p>

<p>
Their sweetness and gentleness of manner,
together with their undeniable beauty,
attracted and won the&mdash;at first
suspicious&mdash;landlady, who bustled about and
prepared tea for them.  She, however, put
great weight upon an introduction coming
through her nephew Joe; and her
confidence grew apace when she found Mary
scrupulously correct in her weekly
payments, and others of every kind, and thus
she complacently tolerated the presence of
Jack in her household.  To have parted
with him would have stricken Mary's
heart.
</p>

<p>
Ere the first day of their residence with
her was past, they were in full possession
of Mrs. Fubsby's personal history, which
she thrust upon them with that loquacious
communicativeness peculiar to the English
lower orders&mdash;at least so much of it as
she cared to tell&mdash;how her maiden name
was Seraphina-Mary-Ann&mdash;how she had
married a gentleman, who, however, did
not behave as such in the end, as he had
left her years ago, and she was now
reduced to have lodgers or boarders, and so
forth.
</p>

<p>
Coming from a secluded country place
like their Perthshire parish, Mary and
Ellinor had no real idea of the world or of
life, as it is called&mdash;more than all, the
bustling, busy, tearing, selfish, and
suspicious life of London, or the mighty and
close race for existence there.  They knew
not yet that without friends and
introductions employments in teaching music or
drawing were all but unattainable.
</p>

<p>
A few days passed on.  Advertisements
were studied daily and replied to
sedulously; but no answer came.  They could
not know that for each of these
employments there might be two thousand
applicants!  So their poor hearts grew
hopeless and weary&mdash;often sick with alarm as
money dwindled away; and day by day
they looked out, either on the frowsy
churchyard, where not a blade of grass
grew between the closely packed
tombstones, or the equally frowsy canal, with
its barges cleaving the muddy water and
oozy slime; and as they were totally
ignorant of London, for a time, the poor
girls supposed it must be <i>all</i> like their
then sordid surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Paddington, where Francois Thurot, the
famous corsair, won the bride in whose
arms he died in battle, and where in the
last century the Guards coming from
Hounslow were wont to halt for the night,
prior to marching for the little London of
George II., was, some fifty years ago, a
kind of suburban village, a rural and
pretty place, with its grassy green and the
old 'Wheatsheaf' Tavern, where Ben
Jonson drank his beer, even after its quaint
Gothic church, where the Sheldons were
entombed by its solemn yew-tree, was
replaced by the present hideous square
edifice, with its pillared portico and
trumpery cupola starting from amid that
veritable stoneyard of graveslabs, among
which lie the remains of the beautiful
Mrs. Siddons and of the luckless painter
Haydon&mdash;an odious and festering place, where,
Dr. Ashburner tells us in his work on
'The Dynamics,' his nervous patients were
wont to see nightly the pale and lambent
dead-lights rising from the corrupted
soil.
</p>

<p>
Whether it was the result of all she had
undergone of late, or that the atmosphere
of the place affected Ellinor, Mary never
knew; but her colour faded out&mdash;the ruddy
tint left her lips, and her dark hazel eyes
grew dull as she became prostrated by a
nervous illness, which added sorely to the
cares, the troubles, and expenses of the
latter, for Ellinor required wine and many
little luxuries.
</p>

<p>
Energy seemed to have left her.  Ellinor
was but twenty, but already her life
seemed over and done with!
</p>

<p>
And now that her secret love affair was
apparently a thing completely of the past,
Ellinor showed Mary the gift of Sir
Redmond, and bursting into a flood of
hysterical tears told her all&mdash;of the baffled
elopement; and then Mary, catching up Jack,
covered the dog with kisses.
</p>

<p>
There were at least two reasons why
no letters ever reached Dr. Wodrow, and
that, to him, the movements of the sisters
seemed involved in painful mystery.
</p>

<p>
Two letters that Mary wrote to him had
miscarried, and, as no answers came to
them, with over-sensitiveness and doubt,
she misconstrued the silence of her good
old friend, and, believing that he resented
Ellinor's treatment of his son, would now
ignore their existence.
</p>

<p>
'I shall write no more,' said Mary.
'Can it be that Lady Dunkeld has ruined
us among those who knew us?  If so,
there is one use in adversity&mdash;we can tell
our friends from our enemies.'
</p>

<p>
So in sorrowful doubt she did not write
again; seeking for employment and
nursing Ellinor occupied all the thoughts of
Mary, who became almost distracted with
a fear that the former might be sent by
Mrs. Fubsby to a common hospital.
Nothing, perhaps, was further from the good
woman's thoughts; but Mary had heard,
or read, of such things.  Thus, fully
occupied, she wrote no more; and, as
time went past, the mystery grew at the
manse of Kirktoun-Mailler, and in the mind
of Colville also.  Everything painful,
horrible, and disastrous was fancied, and
advertisements put by the latter in the <i>Times</i>,
however carefully yet pointedly worded,
were never seen by Mary.  So in these
our days of penny post and cheap telegrams,
they remained lost, untraced, and
undiscovered by those who loved them
best.
</p>

<p>
She had both confidence and patience;
and patience is mental strength
concentrated.  Her religious education had also
taught her resignation, and she felt that
'let the sands drop through the glass ever
so slowly, there is a time when they end;
there is a time for us all; no matter the
hour, for God thinks it the best.'
</p>

<p>
Yet often as she sat, busy with crewel
work for sale, by Ellinor's bedside, the
notes of the passing bell in the cupola of
the adjacent church&mdash;a toll unknown in
Scotland&mdash;smote a gloom upon her heart
with every measured stroke.
</p>

<p>
No pessimist was Mary Wellwood in
temper or heart, and no manufacturer of
artificial sorrow; yet the idea occurred to
her with terror&mdash;what if she should lose
Ellinor, and be left alone in this bitter
world?
</p>

<p>
As petty trifles, like airs and scraps of
frivolous songs, will haunt the mind in
times of dire calamity, even of death,
Mary's thoughts would run persistently on
the feathered pets and flowers she had once
at home&mdash;even on the sparrows for which
she was daily wont to spread crumbs,
where they would find none now; and she
actually envied her old owl; he, at least,
was at home in his ivied ruin, that looked
down on Invermay.
</p>

<p>
Thinking thus, Mary would sit in the
evening twilight by the open window,
through which came the roar of mighty
London; but not the flower-scented air
that hovered over their lost home; and
while the stars, dimly seen in the smoke-laden
sky of London, stole into sight, she
thought of the green Ochil peaks, over
which the same stars were shining brightly,
like vast diamonds set in azure.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor recovered and gained strength,
but still able to do little with her pencil.
</p>

<p>
Evening walks, as among the green
lanes and shady paths in the glen where
the May flows, they could have no more
now.  They seldom saw the sun set; and
when evening fell the streets in their
vicinity became filled by people whose
appearance appalled them.  There were
vicious-looking men and more vicious-looking
women from the adjacent Edgware
Road; vendors of carrion on wooden
skewers, known as 'cat's-meat;' vendors
of roasted potatoes and chestnuts; boiled
oranges; of plums, the bloom of which was
due to clothes-blue; vendors of milk, the
component parts of which made one shudder;
of queerly-painted pugs and yellow-painted
sparrows; of red pots of earth,
with rootless twigs of flowers stuck in
them&mdash;another London dodge&mdash;yet declared
by the vendors to be 'all a-growing&mdash;all
a-blowing.'
</p>

<p>
With such plants as these Mrs. Fubsby
was not to be 'took in,' and so preferred
paper flowers.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor contrived to finish one of her
best landscapes&mdash;a view on the May&mdash;and
'room' was given it by a kind of picture-dealer
close by, but it remained in his window
unsold, and apparently unnoticed by
all&mdash;save the flies, who did not improve it.
</p>

<p>
Mary's confidence at times began to
desert her when she felt how hard it would
be for them, all unaided as they were, to
win their daily bread and add to the little
pittance they had, among that vast human
tide of busy, cold, careless, and apparently
unsympathising people who poured past
her in the streets.
</p>

<p>
Her sweet face began to look anxious,
sorrowful, and pale under the ripples of
golden brown hair that fell softly over her
broad low forehead; and ere long the two
sisters began to want many things to which
they had been accustomed.
</p>

<p>
'What is to be the end of it all?' Mary
would think, as she came slowly back to
tell Ellinor of some fresh disappointment,
or that her picture was still unsold.  Mary
was growing paler, Ellinor could see&mdash;yes,
she looked older; her figure seemed less
round, though graceful as ever.  Her
street dress was beginning to look poor
and even shabby.  Oh, how sad and
horrible it was!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Fubsby pitied the girls for their
want of success, while she admired their
perseverance.  A well-meaning woman, she
had some suggestions to 'hoffer,' as she
said, which made Mary's blood run cold.
</p>

<p>
Among these were two&mdash;that, as she
was 'so 'andsome,' she might get a
situation in the mantle department of some
great shop, or as a species of lay-figure to
show off the goods, and who knew but one
of the 'walkers' might take a fancy to
her? or to work a sewing-machine in the
window in the gaze of all those men and
boys who would be certain to crowd thereat,
and flatten their noses against the glass
while critically surveying her.  Another
suggestion was to sell poor Jack, whom
Joe Fubsby said was well worth 'a ten
pun' note;' but Mary would rather have
starved than parted with her dog.
</p>

<p>
With a burning cheek and a beating
heart, and feeling certain that she would
be viewed with suspicion, and perhaps
insulted, she ventured into a shop in the
Edgware Road, where an 'honest' dealer
gave her less than the third of the value
for Sir Redmond's chain and locket.  This
sum helped them on a little; but again
finances began to fall, and, clasping her
slim white hands, Mary began to think it
was useless attempting to struggle any
more.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
NO. 60, PARK LANE.
</h3>

<p>
In a work of fiction, says a writer, 'the
reader will find a hundred strange
meetings and coincidences&mdash;old lovers coming
face to face after years of separation,
friends thought dead rising up at the
corners of the streets, and the good
characters appearing <i>ad libitum</i> to confound all
the bad in the concluding chapters.  Critics,'
he adds, 'laugh at all these wires which
pull the Minerva puppets, but <i>real life</i> has
often, more than one imagines, its strange
meetings and coincidences too&mdash;old lovers
and friends do start as from Hades into
our presence sometimes, and if a good
genius in the shape of a father, or big
brother, or a policeman did not come to
the rescue at times when the last hope was
failing us, what a deal more misery there
would be in the world.'
</p>

<p>
Thus it was, through this doctrine of
strange chances, that Mary Wellwood was
soon fated to meet Colville on two
occasions, and they came to pass as follows.
</p>

<p>
Mary had clever little hands, and had
frequently made up <i>such</i> caps for
Mrs. Fubsby, and arranged her ribbons and
laces so nicely, that she conceived the idea
of obtaining some employment for her
needle, as Ellinor still required many little
things that were procured for her with
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
With high beating heart she one day
entered a millinery establishment, and
timidly suggested that she was clever as a
worker, at trimming, cap and bonnet-making,
and entreated a trial to be given
her.  Her soft voice and pleading face
went for nothing.  She was repelled coldly,
even superciliously, and the door was
pretty plainly indicated to her; so she
issued forth into the bustle of the Edgeware
Road again with a heavy, bitter, and
irrepressible sigh.
</p>

<p>
It was a dull and depressing day early
in October, when what remains to us of
foliage and sunshine are held on a
precarious tenure indeed, and people become
conscious of 'snow in the air;' when the
gardener's work consists chiefly of 'sweeping
up' the leaves that come rustling down
and tidying borders after the blasts of
wind.  Frost, however, had not come, and
the parterres of Hyde Park, the phloxes
and the late gladioli, still continued to
make a brave show, though the dahlias
drooped heavily when the dews fell.
Overhead the sky was dull and leaden, of the
usual London tint, and no one could tell
in what quarter of it the sun was hidden.
</p>

<p>
Mary peeped into the dealer's window,
and another sigh escaped her.  Ellinor's
landscape was still there, and, of course,
unsold; so again she thought to herself,
'what was to be the end of it all?'
</p>

<p>
As a last effort she sought a music shop,
where she had often given specimens of
her accomplishments on the piano, and
where she had frequently applied, without
success, for pupils.
</p>

<p>
The proprietors liked her voice, but her
pale face, with its rare charm of expression,
and soft violet-blue eyes, was beginning
to have a sad and hunted look.
They also (for they were judges) liked her
manner&mdash;who did not?&mdash;so faultless and
graceful in its self-possession even yet, and
her tones so sweetly modulated and pleasant;
thus they were honestly anxious to
help her if they could, and had hinted if
she took to the stage she might make a
fortune in 'the profession.'
</p>

<p>
They had heard of no pupils yet; but
music&mdash;a musician&mdash;an accomplished
pianist was wanted for a dance, to be given on
the morrow night&mdash;two guineas were the
honorarium&mdash;would she accept it?
</p>

<p>
She thought what the sum might get
for Ellinor, and accepted the proposal at
once.
</p>

<p>
The money would be paid her at the house.
</p>

<p>
'Where is it?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'No. 60, Park Lane.'
</p>

<p>
And her informant added that she must
go nicely&mdash;at least neatly&mdash;dressed; and
she hurried home with a lighter heart.
Distasteful though the position and
occupation, it was at least a beginning, and no
one knew aught of her or her antecedents.
</p>

<p>
Next night she attired herself with care,
gracefully, and, perhaps, artistically, in a
soft and clinging lace-trimmed dress of
creamy Indian muslin.  It was perhaps
rather too much for the <i>rôle</i> she had to
play; but it was one of her best costumes,
with lace at her white slender throat,
and shading her bare and very lovely
arms, while her only ornament was a single
white rose in her breast.  So, gloved,
shawled, and with her roll of music, she
drove away in a 'growler,' the last words
she heard being expressions of admiration
at her appearance from Ellinor and Mrs. Fubsby.
</p>

<p>
On past the Marble Arch, and into that
aristocratic line of varied and strange-looking
houses, Park Lane, which, in the
time of Queen Anne, was generally known
as 'the lane leading to Tyburn,' where
the gallows bore its ghastly freight.
</p>

<p>
'Number sixty,' she again told her
cabman, when he suddenly pulled up, and
she now remembered that she had omitted
to ask to whose house she was going.
Though she ought to have been there
among, or prior to, the first arrivals, the
position was so new to her that she was
a little late, and already several carriages
were on the line before her, 'setting
down,' at a lighted portico, duly furnished
with a striped canopy and carpeted steps.
Thus, during the brief pause that ensued,
she was enabled to see that it was a
stately house she was bound for.  Though
October, the night was fine, and the
windows were open.  She obtained, through
them, a glimpse of a splendidly-furnished
double drawing-room, with blue silk
curtains festooned within an arch; already
several guests were gliding to and fro,
and the fragrance of flowers and perfumes
was wafted outward on the night air.
</p>

<p>
A painted and partially curtained
verandah overhung the garden&mdash;a verandah
made like a fairy abode by shrubs and
flowers, by Chinese lanterns, ottomans,
and couches; and she felt a strange,
spasmodic tightening of the heart, for there
was a figure that seemed familiar to her
hanging over a lovely girl, who was flirting
languidly with her fan.
</p>

<p>
As one in a dream, she found herself
deposited at the door, and ascending with
her music-roll the fast crowding staircase
that led to the dancing-room, attended by
a footman as a guide; but the lady of the
house, whoever she was, did not condescend
to receive her.  And her pretty bare
arms were noticed as she seated herself
at the piano-stool.  She had too much
dress 'for one in her position,' some
matrons thought suspiciously, all the more
so that many men remarked and admired
her; but she adjusted her music and
programme, bent her sweet face closely
over the former, and played on, and on,
and on, till her little fingers ached, oh, so
wearily, into the hours of the night and
the early hours of the morning.
</p>

<p>
But ere the latter came one or two
episodes occurred.
</p>

<p>
She discovered, first, that she was in
the house of Lord Dunkeld!  Parliament
was sitting, and his lordship, as one of
the precious sixteen called
'Representative Peers,' was consequently in town;
but for all the good he ever did Scotland
or her interests he might as well have
been at the North Pole.
</p>

<p>
To Mary Wellwood, with her sensitive
pride and memories of the past, this was
a sickening discovery to make!  There
was, however, no retreating now.  She
resolutely kept her face from the guests,
and played on as one in a dream, with
the soft patter of feet and whirling of
skirts in her ear.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice she thought that the cold,
calm eyes of Lady Dunkeld recognised
her, and then, flushing deep to the nape
of her delicate neck, she bent lower still
over her music.  If it was so, the pale
and handsome peeress made no sign, and
gave not the slightest evidence of
recognition.
</p>

<p>
The longing to be gone in Mary's heart
was intense, and to her the hours of that
night seemed interminable.
</p>

<p>
Though 'town was empty,' as she heard,
she was thankful that the rooms were
crowded to excess; that the dancers had
scarcely room to move, and thus she had
the less chance of recognition.
</p>

<p>
Mouthing fools with lisping lips, parted
hair, and a great display of shirt-front
were there, and men of brilliant intellect
too, with many stately women and lovely
girls such as London alone can boast; and
Blanche Galloway moved among them
like a bewitching little queen, superbly
dressed by all the care of Rosette.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Mary had another shock and
tightening of the heart when two familiar
voices fell on her ear, and she discovered
near her Colville&mdash;Colville and Sir Redmond
Sleath, the latter, as usual in
accurate evening costume, with his tawny
moustache, <i>insouciant</i> air, and china-blue
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The sense of Colville's presence
suffocated her, and memory went back to that
last interview in which he suddenly drew
her towards him and kissed her so tenderly
and hurried away on their being interrupted,
leaving unsaid what he was bound
in honour to say, but urging her to do
nothing rash until 'to-morrow'&mdash;the
morrow that never came!
</p>

<p>
'Hah, when did you come to town?'
asked Sir Redmond.
</p>

<p>
'More than a month ago,' replied Colville.
</p>

<p>
'From Craigmhor?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; you left before I did, you remember?'
</p>

<p>
'Sudden business called me to town.
When you left how were our fair friends
at Birkwoodbrae?'
</p>

<p>
It was terrible for Mary to sit there
helplessly and overhear this conversation;
but there was a buzzing sound in her ears,
and she failed to catch Colville's answer;
and Sleath spoke again&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I knew you were deuced spooney on the
eldest one.  Got over it all now, of
course&mdash;<i>pour passer le temps</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Spooney?  I do not choose to have this
term applied either to myself or the lady
referred to.'
</p>

<p>
'As you please.  But surely you had no
more intention of committing yourself
seriously with her than I had with her
younger sister?'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean by talking of these
young ladies in this style to me?' asked
Colville, in a voice that seemed to have
suppressed passion in it, for at that
moment he was recalling some of Doctor
Wodrow's communications regarding the speaker.
</p>

<p>
'Why, what on earth are they to you?
demanded Sleath, focussing him with his eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
Mary did not hear the response, but was
aware that Sleath started and said,
</p>

<p>
'What new dodge is this?'
</p>

<p>
'I am thinking of going to India again,'
said Colville, bluntly, to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
'Again&mdash;with all your wealth&mdash;what
folly!'
</p>

<p>
'I seem to have neither kith nor kin to
care for, or aught to keep me here now.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;that red-coat business!'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'As some one says, "We all know that
half a man's life is often spent in wanting
to put on the red-coat, and the other half
in wanting to put it off."'
</p>

<p>
'No part of <i>your</i> life is likely to be
spent in either, Sir Redmond,' said Colville,
as he turned on his heel and left him.
</p>

<p>
'To India again,' whispered Mary in her
heart; 'he thinks of going to India!
Well&mdash;what is he to me&mdash;what am I to him?'
</p>

<p>
Mary observed that he danced little, if
at all, and that he certainly looked
grave&mdash;even sad and preoccupied, as he had
never done at Birkwoodbrae.
</p>

<p>
Colville had never enlightened the
Dunkeld family, even before leaving
Craigmhor, of his relationship to the missing
sisters, or of those views, intentions, and
the little romantic plan between himself
and Dr. Wodrow, which had proved the
cause of so much distress and mischief.
</p>

<p>
Blanche Galloway, her rival, as Mary
began to deem her again, was the gayest
of the throng there, and, leaning on
Colville's arm clingingly after a long swinging
waltz, was fanning herself, and laughing
at some remark that was, in her own
parlance, 'quite too awfully funny.'
</p>

<p>
Intent on Colville and on others too,
smiling her brightest upon them all, but
on him in particular, and bestowing flowers
with great <i>empressement</i> from her ample
bouquet, as she sat with them in the
dimly-lighted conservatory, and flirted with
a science born of her partly French blood,
she never bestowed a thought on the
weary and silent musician, any more than
on the aiguletted valets who took about
the jellies and ices, etc.
</p>

<p>
Mary saw that Colville sat out dances,
often with pretty companions, over whom
his handsome head was bent low in
confidential conversation, while he fanned
them with gallant assiduity.
</p>

<p>
'You play most brilliantly, my dear!'
said a soft, sweet voice suddenly in Mary's ear.
</p>

<p>
No one, as yet, had addressed her that
night, and she looked up with a startled
air to see a very handsome and motherly-looking
woman regarding her with kindly interest.
</p>

<p>
'You have a most exquisite touch,' she
continued; 'how I should like my youngest
girl to have some lessons from you&mdash;even
as a permanent musical governess.
May I speak to Lady Dunkeld about it?'
</p>

<p>
'Do not&mdash;please do not!' replied Mary,
imploringly; 'she knows nothing about
me; but I have another reason for
declining&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madam.'
</p>

<p>
'A serious one?'
</p>

<p>
'Very&mdash;a sickly sister whom I cannot
and would not leave to live alone.'
</p>

<p>
'A most creditable reason to give,' said
the elderly lady, and was about to add
something more, when Lady Dunkeld
suddenly drew near, and in a hard, metallic
voice said,
</p>

<p>
'Dear Mrs. Deroubigne, a word with
you before supper.'
</p>

<p>
So, as the lady left her side, Mary
learned that Deroubigne was her name,
and, with gratitude in her heart for the
little bit of praise, recognition, and
sympathy, Mary thought she would never
forget her.
</p>

<p>
The guests filed off to the supper-room,
whence ere long came the murmur of
voices, the sounds of laughter, the clink
of plates and glasses, and looking round
the empty drawing-room, strewed with
fragments of flowers, lace, muslin, and so
forth, Mary, like a hunted creature, thought
only of escape, but was informed that
refreshment for her was set apart from
all the rest in a private apartment.
</p>

<p>
It was a pretty place, with carved oak
furniture, valuable pictures, and the
subdued light of a beautiful lamp was shed
on the dainty napery, silver and quaint
blue and gold service of the repast set
before her; but Mary was incapable of
eating&mdash;food would have choked her.  She
held a glass of wine to her tremulous and
dry lips, but so tremulous too were her
fingers by long playing that she had to set
it down untasted.
</p>

<p>
She then told the valet who attended
her that she was too ill to remain longer,
to make her apologies to Lady Dunkeld,
and to get her shawl and cloak from the
women in charge of the cloak-room.
</p>

<p>
He did so with some surprise, that
increased when, on proffering her two guineas
on a silver salver as her fee, she said,
sharply,
</p>

<p>
'Thanks.  Keep the money, or spend
it in the servants' hall,' and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
'Off her blessed chump, by jingo!'
muttered 'Jeames,' as he thrust the money
into the pocket of his yellow-plush
breeches.
</p>

<p>
Escaping recognition by Mademoiselle
Rosette, who was having a flirtation in the
hall with John Gaiters (Sir Redmond's
man), Mary, in a tumult of distracting
thoughts, cabbed it back to St. Mary's
Terrace, so called, though it is a narrow
<i>street</i>; but that matters nothing in
London, where thoroughfares are called roads,
that are streets or squares, terraces or
crescents, and even hills, such as Ludgate,
or vales, such as Maida, without being the
slightest approach to anything of the kind;
but such are some of the many
idiosyncrasies of Babylon that puzzle the
intelligent foreigner.
</p>

<p>
Mary was a wise girl; she knew that
the wounded heart of Ellinor, suffering
from certain remorse at her treatment of
the loving Robert Wodrow, and mortification
at the conduct of Sleath in never
attempting to visit or seek an explanation,
would not be healed by telling <i>all</i> that
she had overheard, and more that she
suspected, now only said that she had
recognised him and Colville at the ball
and nothing more.
</p>

<p>
But this reticence proved rather a
mistake eventually.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
'SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR!'
</h3>

<p>
After that night at Number 60, Park
Lane, a terrible sense of humiliation
oppressed Mary, and she knew not what to
do next.  Such rencontres, she thought,
were not likely to happen in the mighty
world of London; yet the next meeting
she had with Colville occurred very soon
after, and gave her nearly as great a shock
as that at the ball.
</p>

<p>
It was on a murky October Sunday
afternoon when Mary, finding herself near
Westminster Abbey, entered the vast
building, lured alike by curiosity to see
it and hear the service, for which the bells
were tolling.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she looked about her and
saw how the mighty cruciform church
towered skyward above the dingy houses,
shops, and streets that lie so near it on
one side, and the handsome, open space,
with all its railings and statues, on the
other, and, tripping lightly over the flat
gravestones, she entered by the gloomy
northern door, and, after a little timid
doubt and hesitation, proceeded to an
empty pew in the north transept.
</p>

<p>
The vast height of the shafted columns,
the darkened roof that sprang from them,
the dusky depths and ghostly uncertainties
of the edifice, which was of a size
and space beyond her conception; the
faint, leaden light of the London
afternoon that stole through its lancet
windows, and the grim aspect of the tombs
which crowd and disfigure the long drawn
aisles, were all solemn and oppressive to
Mary, yet curiosity detained her, and she
was glad to see a few persons&mdash;but how
very few they seemed&mdash;gathering to hear
the service, while the black-robed vergers
glided about, imparting, she thought,
something spectral to the vistas of the place;
and to her unaccustomed eyes the white
floating surplices of the officiating
clergymen and of the choir-boys seemed
something spectral too.
</p>

<p>
A great sense of awe came over her as
she thought of all the mighty dead who
lay there, the dead of ages, beneath her
very feet&mdash;politicians, warriors, judges,
princes, and nobles, philanthropists, actors,
and physicians&mdash;the Pantheon of all the
English great&mdash;who in fighting the battle
of life have added to the renown of their
country.  For a time she was drawn from
the constant sense of herself, of her own
sorrows, and the contemplation of thinking
how hard it was to win one's daily bread
in a vast city.
</p>

<p>
Her veil was up, and had any there
regarded her face, they would have seen how
pale and sad it looked under the edge of
her little hat, and the ripples of her golden
brown hair that fell over her forehead, and
how pathetic was the expression of her
long-lashed, violet blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
The bells had ceased to clash overhead,
and a few people were seated or kneeling
on hassocks in the chancel seats, while
some gas jets began to flicker out as the
afternoon light faded from the pointed
windows; and then the deep swell of the
organ, and the sweet voices of the
choristers stirred Mary's heart, and moved her
to tears, she knew not why, for the
solemnity of the scene soothed, while the music
comforted her, and to hide her emotion she
drew down her veil closely.
</p>

<p>
While the psalm was being chanted
three ladies entered the pew before her,
and as there was not room in it for a
gentleman who accompanied them he took his
seat behind them, in the pew occupied by
Mary, and close to her side.
</p>

<p>
Her heart stood still, and again the
sense of suffocation came with a spasm into
her slender throat, for he who sat beside
her was Colville, and the ladies were
Blanche Galloway, Lady Dunkeld, and
Mrs. Deroubigne!
</p>

<p>
She respired with difficulty, and then her
heart beat fast; the service was
forgotten&mdash;unheard, all save the swelling of the
organ, which only seemed an element in
the phantasmagoria around her now; and
she strove&mdash;but that was impossible&mdash;to
forget who was by her side, and almost
touching her.
</p>

<p>
She wondered if he would recognise her
figure; he could scarcely fail to do so, if he
looked at her; but he never did so, and
seemed wholly intent on looking into the
dusky obscurities of the church, or was
lost in his own thoughts.  He had placed
a hand ungloved, with a gold signet ring
thereon&mdash;a ring the crest of which Mary
remembered well&mdash;on the edge of the pew
in which Blanche was seated; and making
a half turn round, with a bright and
coquettish smile, she rested her back against
his fingers, as much as to say, she felt
them there caressingly.
</p>

<p>
Mary observed this, and also that after
a time he withdrew his hand, with an air
of unconsciousness, she thought.
</p>

<p>
Blanche wore a magnificent sealskin
paletot, which contrasted powerfully with
Mary's somewhat faded jacket and equally
faded dress.  How happy and bright and
well nourished she looked.  There was no
care, no thought, no anxiety in her
sparkling dark eyes.  Unlike Mary, she had no
dark or dubious future looming far away
before her.
</p>

<p>
Mary remembered&mdash;when was she likely
to forget?&mdash;that he said he had no one to
care for, and was going away to India; and yet
he seemed to be on remarkably intimate and
pleasant terms with these Dunkeld people.
She fancied that Blanche had given him a
conscious and disappointed glance, when
he left her to take his seat behind her, as
if she seemed to think his proper place was
by her own side; and perhaps Mary might
have seen a disappointed look in his face,
had she seen it at the time.
</p>

<p>
They might only be friends, but somehow
Blanche gave the silent watcher the bitter
conviction that she was certainly something
more.
</p>

<p>
Mary knew that Colville had denied
being engaged to Blanche, and ridiculed
the rumour as Mrs. Wodrow's gossip.
True&mdash;but he might be engaged to her <i>now</i>.
</p>

<p>
'If he still cares for me,' she thought,
'what a different answer would I give him
now.  If not engaged, why are they thus
together, and why does she give him these
conscious and confident glances?  Was he
deceiving me at&mdash;at Birkwoodbrae?'
</p>

<p>
When Mary had taken her seat in that
pew, she felt a sense of awful loneliness;
but she felt many, many degrees more
lonely now.  She felt also far, far removed
from him, and those whom he accompanied,
in her homely life and sordid surroundings
at Paddington.  A vast gulf seemed
thereby to have opened between her and
Colville, such as did not exist at
Birkwoodbrae; and she thought of the day when
they fished together in the May, and other
days of delicious walks and rambles under
the drooping birches by the sparkling linn,
or among the scented pine woods that
were overlooked by the lovely green hills,
amid the bright sunshine and the odour of
the purple heather&mdash;of thoughts that came
and went&mdash;of hopes that dawned, and of
words that were uttered, or left unuttered.
At last the service was over, and the
few people who assembled to hear it&mdash;many
of them strangers only come to view
the church from curiosity&mdash;were hastening
away.
</p>

<p>
As Mary rose, Colville did so too that
she might pass him.
</p>

<p>
Still there was no recognition on his
part; his eyes were on Blanche Galloway,
and Mary quickly glided out of the church.
The rain was beginning to fall in the chill
October evening, and drawing her shawl
close about her she set out on her way
homeward, feeling that she would be
thankful for a seat in an omnibus.
</p>

<p>
When she looked back, with an impulse
she could not resist, she saw Colville come
forth with Blanche, the other two ladies
following, as if the arrangement was a
tacit one.  They all entered the stately
Dunkeld carriage, the driver and servants
of which wore ample fur tippets.  The
door was closed with a bang, and they
drove off, passing Mary on the way, and
bestowing on her a few spots of mud.
</p>

<p>
'To be so near&mdash;and yet so far!' she
thought, with a greater bitterness of heart
than she ever thought to feel&mdash;she was
usually so resigned and sweetly patient;
but she seemed to know the worst now,
and that all was over at last.
</p>

<p>
The very circumstance of her having to
wander alone and unescorted through the
streets of London on such an evening
seemed to impress upon her still more the
difference of position, and the gulf that
lay between her and those she had seen
whirling away, as she doubted not, to
No. 60, Park Lane.
</p>

<p>
That she had been recognised by some
one there on the night of the ball, she
thought she had mortifying proof when
next she presented herself before the
hitherto friendly proprietors of the
music-shop in quest of pupils or some
employment.
</p>

<p>
She found their manner curt, changed,
and cold.
</p>

<p>
'You need return no more,' she was
told.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'You failed to give satisfaction when we
found you employment last.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way?' asked Mary, in a
breathless voice.
</p>

<p>
'Lady Dunkeld informed us that you
left the house abruptly and in a mysterious
way.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Dunkeld!  So she in the plentitude
of her wealth, power, and position
was following up with a vendetta poor
Mary Wellwood.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
'SOME DAY.'
</h3>

<p>
The sale of Ellinor's landscape for a sum
beyond what she had expected for it, came
like a gleam of hope to the two lonely
girls, and the place in the window where
it had hung so long was now empty.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder who bought it?' said she.
</p>

<p>
'That matters little,' replied Mary; 'his
fancy, however, will give you encouragement,
nevertheless.'
</p>

<p>
Ellinor blushed with pleasure.  Her
picture was sold, but she little knew to
whom.
</p>

<p>
She was now convalescent, able to go
abroad, and, like Mary, she had also the
coincidence of a strange and unexpected
meeting.
</p>

<p>
One day, when the weather was clear
and sunny for the season, she went to
Hyde Park with her sketch-book, encouraged
to fresh efforts by her success, to
make another drawing.  The subject was
to be some quaint old trees she had
noticed, and which she hoped might find
a purchaser in some one who knew the
locality.
</p>

<p>
October had given these old oaks its
choicest tints, and, while some of their
leaves were russet-green, others were like
burnished bronze, and were red of many
hues; and, all the better for artistic
purposes, the chief of these venerable and
gnarled trees had a story, for under it
Horace Walpole, as he tells us, was robbed
in the winter of 1749 by the fashionable
footpad Maclean.
</p>

<p>
'One night in the beginning of November,'
he writes, 'as I was returning from
Holland House by moonlight, about ten
o'clock, I was attacked by two highwaymen
in Hyde Park, and the pistol of one
of them, going off accidentally, razed the
skin under my eye, left some marks of
shot on my face, and stunned me.  The
ball went through my hat, and, if I had
sat an inch nearer to the left side, it must
have gone through my head.'
</p>

<p>
This event occurred within half-a-mile
of Piccadilly, and Ellinor, thinking how it
would enhance the value of her little
landscape, set to work in sketching the group
of trees.
</p>

<p>
So intent was she with her pencil that
for some time she was unaware that she
was observed, or that anyone was near her
in that part of the then usually deserted
Park, till she suddenly saw a soldier&mdash;a
hussar&mdash;standing before her.
</p>

<p>
'Robert&mdash;Robert Wodrow!' she exclaimed,
in a strange voice all unlike
her own, as the pencil dropped from her
nerveless hand.  'What does this
dress&mdash;what does all this mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Ask yourself, Ellinor.'
</p>

<p>
Tears started to her eyes at the familiar
voice, and so glad was she to see his
familiar face that, but for his too
probable misconception of her feelings and
the eyes of passers-by, she would have
thrown her arms round his neck and
kissed him.
</p>

<p>
All unaware that he was so near her,
Robert Wodrow had been strolling through
the Park, thinking the while of a song
that Ellinor had been wont to sing to him
often in past days&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Some day, some day I shall meet you&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, I know not when or how&mdash;<br />
  Only this, only this, that once you loved me:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this, I love you now, I love you now!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The tender and passionate refrain was
in his mind, and actually hovering on his
lips, when the face and form of Ellinor
came suddenly before him.
</p>

<p>
'So you can amuse yourself thus,' said
he, picking up her pencil, 'and in spite of
all the misery that has fallen on me.'
</p>

<p>
'I am working thus for daily bread,
Robert; and, oh, I knew not that you had
taken this terrible step.'
</p>

<p>
'Becoming a soldier?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
Robert Wodrow was again face to face
with the girl he loved with a love so
unselfish and passionate, and so ungrudgingly
given in all its fulness and tenderness,
yet he made no attempt to take her hand.
</p>

<p>
She thought that he never looked so
handsome as he did then, in his smart
hussar tunic&mdash;blue, faced with red and
braided with yellow.  Club drill and sword
exercise had developed every muscle, while
setting-up drill and the riding-school had
given him that air and bearing our light
cavalrymen alone possess.
</p>

<p>
'Why cast away thus your prospects in
life?' she asked, sadly.
</p>

<p>
'I have none&mdash;I lost them with you.'
</p>

<p>
'What dear friends we might have been&mdash;nay,
were, if with friendship you would
have been content, Robert!'
</p>

<p>
'A view you only adopted after Sir
Redmond Sleath came.'
</p>

<p>
Her pale face coloured deeply, and
perhaps guiltily, at this response, and he
regarded her earnestly.  She was pale
certainly, and her lips had a pathetic little
droop in them, though their wonderful
sweetness of expression yet remained, but
her cheeks had lost some of their girlish
roundness and bloom.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere of most unclassic Paddington,
with its frowsy canal and fœtid
churchyard, was truly somewhat different
from the breeze that swept the Ochil
ranges and down through the Birks of
Invermay.
</p>

<p>
Robert realised at that moment how
dear, how inexpressibly dear to him, was
the girl he had lost, and between whom
and himself he had now opened a complete
social gulf, and how their past friendship
and love had crept into his heart and
settled there, making her still more precious
to him than life itself.
</p>

<p>
When he spoke again his voice was
strained and husky, and the tones of it
were as those of a man in mortal pain.
</p>

<p>
'How is dear Mary?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;very well.'
</p>

<p>
'From a remark you let fall about daily
bread, Ellinor,' said he, playing nervously
with the lash of his riding-switch, 'I can
gather that you are not married to that man.'
</p>

<p>
'Most certainly not.  I have never seen
him since we left home&mdash;for to us home is
not here.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank God for your assertion!  I have
heard a good deal about him among our
fellows; he is a deuced bad lot, and may
yet find you out.  If he does, I beg of you
to pause, however brilliant his offers of
marriage may be.  He dare have no other
view; if he had, if he had,' continued
Robert Wodrow, with his teeth set under
his dark moustache, 'and the grave had
me, I would come back to have vengeance
on him!  Remember my words, I implore
you, Ellinor, by memory of the pleasant
past, when we were boy and girl together.
It is the last favour I can ask of you, and
too probably this is the last time we shall
meet on earth!'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, Robert?' she said,
in an agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
'I am only here for a day from Hounslow
Barracks, and in about a week the
regiment embarks for India&mdash;for
Afghanistan, thank God!'
</p>

<p>
'How bitterly you speak!'
</p>

<p>
'I gave up father, mother, home, peace,
and profession when I lost you; but,
pardon me, I did not mean to upbraid.'
</p>

<p>
'Forgive me for all I have made you
suffer,' said Ellinor, humbly; 'I feel how
unworthy I am of all this great regard,'
she added, taking his hand caressingly
between hers; and then, conscious of how
her touch thrilled through him, she
withdrew her clasp, and both seemed on the
verge of tears, and might perhaps have
indulged in them but for the vicinity of
one or two observant and inquisitive
nursemaids, who marvelled at the interest the
young lady evidently took in the
handsome hussar.
</p>

<p>
'And now I must go,' said the latter,
but lingered still, and, cut to the heart
with sorrow for him, Ellinor pressed her
hands upon her breast, as she yielded to
her better nature, but felt that now it was
impossible to retrace or reverse the past.
</p>

<p>
'And you leave England for that far-away
land so soon?'
</p>

<p>
'The sooner the better.'
</p>

<p>
'Won't you come and see Mary ere you go?'
</p>

<p>
'I should indeed like to see dear Mary
once again&mdash;she was always true to me,'
said Robert.
</p>

<p>
'Do come, then,' urged Ellinor, heedless
of the deduction.
</p>

<p>
'Not now, for I am almost due at
Hounslow; but when I come, I must
be&mdash;in uniform.'
</p>

<p>
'That matters nothing; no one here
knows us or cares for us.  Oh, how happy
she will be to see you in one sense, and so
sorry in another!  The uniform is but a
trifle in one way.'
</p>

<p>
'Moments make the year, and trifles
life,' said Robert, with bitter smile,
quoting Young's satire.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor gave him their address&mdash;they
shook hands like friends, these two who
might have been all in the world to each
other, though in the world their paths in
life would lie far apart now&mdash;there was a
minute's pause, and in a moment more
Ellinor was alone.
</p>

<p>
Her drawing was effectually marred for
the day; her head swam and her hand
shook, and forgetting all about Horace
Walpole's tree, she slowly quitted the park.
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow!' she thought, as the
hitherto restrained tears flowed under her
veil, 'I have used him ill&mdash;and yet how
soft and gentle he is with me!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
JACK SHOWS HIS TEETH.
</h3>

<p>
Fortune seemed to be looking kindly on
Mary and Ellinor now, when the
former, through an advertisement, got a
couple of pupils, little girls, in the
neighbourhood of Portman Square, and the
latter had actually sold her landscape, and
started another.
</p>

<p>
'The Linn on the May' had caught the
eye of Sir Redmond Sleath when passing
the shop window, not that he particularly
cared about pictures or art of any kind,
save the culinary one, but he thought he
recognised the subject&mdash;even the style
and the landscape&mdash;and on looking more
closely, after adjusting his inevitable
eyeglass, an exclamation of surprise or
satisfaction, perhaps both, escaped him on
discovering the initials 'E.W.' in one of the
lower corners, and he entered the shop at
once to inspect the landscape more closely.
</p>

<p>
'I think I know the artist,' said he
to the bowing dealer, who was not much
accustomed to visitors of Sleath's style
and bearing.  'A young lady, is she not?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir&mdash;yes&mdash;Miss Ellinor Wellwood.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought so.  I'll take her work.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, sir.  Shall I send it to
your address, your club, or where, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Neither.  I'll take it with me.'
</p>

<p>
Cautious in his plans, Sleath was reluctant
to give his address, but the price
was soon agreed upon, and the money paid.
</p>

<p>
'I want a pair, and will order just such
another,' said he.  'Perhaps you can give
me Miss Ellinor Wellwood's address?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly, sir.  She lives very near this.'
</p>

<p>
'Near this!  By Jove!'
</p>

<p>
He obtained the number and the street,
and went off with the landscape, and with
curious emotions of hope and evil blended
exultantly in his heart.
</p>

<p>
'Paddington?' he muttered, as he walked
off towards the Marble Arch.  'D&mdash;nme,
what a game!  Are they so reduced, or
so ignorant, as to hang out there?
Courage, Redmond, my boy, and that charming
bit of muslin may be your own yet.'
</p>

<p>
Sleath had been told plainly enough,
and sternly too, by Colville, at Lady
Dunkeld's ball, that Mary and Ellinor were his
cousins, who were ignorant of his identity;
but the too-knowing baronet did not
believe a word of his assertions, and, seeing
the matter through the medium of his own
evil mind, supposed the story was 'only
a red herring drawn across the scent'&mdash;a
dodge for purposes of the Guardsman's
own&mdash;so he sought counsel of Mr. John
Gaiters, while the latter prepared for him
some brandy and seltzer-water.
</p>

<p>
'I am awfully spoony on a girl, Gaiters,'
said he.
</p>

<p>
'That is nothing new, Sir Redmond;
but it won't last.'
</p>

<p>
'It never does, I fear.'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not with you, sir,' was the
flippant reply of the valet.
</p>

<p>
'Here is her name and address.  You
will know her again when you see her, but
she must not know you.  Find out all
about her&mdash;who she is living with, and all
the rest of it&mdash;and you will do for me
that which nothing can repay.'
</p>

<p>
'By jingo, sir, I would rather do
something that could be repaid.'
</p>

<p>
'Here is a fiver, anyway, and now be off.'
</p>

<p>
Duly instructed, a couple of days
afterwards, and disguised by a false beard
and moustache, and clad in a tolerably
accurate morning suit, Mr. John Gaiters,
turning up his already tip-tilted nose at
having to traverse so unaristocratic a
locality as Paddington, soon found the
terrace and the number, and after an
external survey of the house, by means of
the knocker brought to the door a little
maid-of-all-work, on whose cheeks was the
black smudge so usual to her class.
</p>

<p>
'Is your mistress at home?' he inquired,
blandly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, is she handsome?  But I need not
ask,' he added, insinuatingly.
</p>

<p>
'Why, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Because, unless her beauty were not of
a more than ordinary character, she could
not afford to have one so excelling as you
by her side.'
</p>

<p>
This high-flown speech, which Gaiters
copied from some of his master's, caused
the little housemaid to think he was mad
or tipsy, and she was about to close the
door with some precipitation, when
Mrs. Fubsby appeared, and, on inquiring for
Miss Ellinor Wellwood, he was informed
she was at home.
</p>

<p>
The dealer had promptly informed Ellinor
that a companion was wanted for her
landscape, and while intent among the
many in her portfolio, she was not
surprised when Mrs. Fubsby announced a
gentleman visitor, who knew her face
instantly, though she failed to recognise the
bearer of many gifts of flowers and game
when at Birkwoodbrae.
</p>

<p>
With all his vulgar assurance, the valet
felt himself for a little time daunted or
abashed by the presence and bearing of
Ellinor, to whom with some hesitation he
told the object of his visit&mdash;he had bought
her picture, and a friend of his wished one
precisely like it; and while he was speaking,
Jack, the terrier, with a dog's strange
instincts, maintained a most unpleasant
snarling under the sofa, and Gaiters,
remembering the episode of his master, felt
correspondingly uneasy.  For 'though love
be proverbially blind, hatred has a sharp
sight,' and so had Jack, who showed his
white glittering teeth from time to time.
'Human beings have their instinctive likes
and dislikes, and why not dogs?' asks a
writer.  'We cannot tell what expression
of countenance they consider malevolent,
or menacing, or murderous; but certain it
is that they often exhibit unaccountable
antipathy to some individual, while most
affectionate and amicable towards all the
rest of the world.'
</p>

<p>
So Jack's antipathy to Sleath now
extended to his emissary Gaiters.
</p>

<p>
The landscape was soon agreed about&mdash;money
was no object to the visitor, who
quickly selected a subject from a rough
sketch, which Ellinor perceived with some
surprise he held upside-down, a curious
fancy in a connoisseur and patron of art,
and, in the interests of his knavish master,
Gaiters, anxious to learn the entire <i>carte
du pays</i>, said,
</p>

<p>
'Do you live here alone, Miss Wellwood?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not Miss Wellwood&mdash;my sister
is,' replied Ellinor, with a little hauteur of
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Is she, too, an artist?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'And you live together&mdash;so sorry I had
not the pleasure of seeing her.'
</p>

<p>
Ellinor thought this evinced curiosity;
but, thinking she might advance the
interests of Mary, she said, as Mr. Gaiters
took up his hat,
</p>

<p>
'At this hour she is usually with her
pupils at Portmore Square.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;at this hour; we must make a
note of that,' thought Mr. John Gaiters,
and, forgetting again to refer to the
landscape, he bowed himself out, hailed a
hansom, and drove away, having obtained all
the information his master wanted&mdash;to
wit, that the sisters were living together,
unprotected, in somewhat humble lodgings,
and that Ellinor, at the particular time
mentioned, was always alone.
</p>

<p>
'Such a pleasant and haffable gentleman,
and with such 'ansome whiskers,'
commented Mrs. Fubsby.  'Drat that
dog&mdash;why did it worrit so about him!'
</p>

<p>
The report made to Sir Redmond by
his subservient emissary piqued and
encouraged him in his nefarious schemes.
</p>

<p>
'Every woman has her price,' thought
he, as he sipped his wine that evening
after a cosy dinner at his club, and
dreamily gazed down the gas-lighted vista of
Pall Mall; 'if not to me, this little one
will become the prize&mdash;the prey of some
other fellow; so, with the basis I have for
future operations, why not to me?  On
some pretence or other I snail get her
wheedled over to the Continent, and then
the game is my own.'
</p>

<p>
In his instance it could not be said that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Evil is wrought by want of thought,<br />
  As well as want of heart,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
for he gave his whole thoughts, and his
heart too&mdash;such as the latter was&mdash;to the
consideration and perfection of his schemes,
and exulted in the idea of outwitting
Colville, if he knew&mdash;as Sleath scarcely doubted
he did&mdash;the residence of the sisters.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE DAUGHTER OF NOX.
</h3>

<p>
'And you have actually found us
out&mdash;here?  How strange!' exclaimed Ellinor,
blushing deeply with pleasure and surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Through my appreciative friend&mdash;appreciative
in art, I mean&mdash;who bought
your charming landscape, the view of that
dear old&mdash;what is it?&mdash;Linn&mdash;Linn of the
May&mdash;yes, darling,' replied Sleath&mdash;Sleath
the slimy, with the china-blue eyes and
Mephistophelian smile, as he twirled out
his tawny moustache, and regarded the
girl with a passionate expression rippling
over his face.  '<i>Après moi le deluge!</i> you
will think, perhaps; but now, darling
Ellinor, that I have found you at last, we
must not part again.'
</p>

<p>
Ere leaving Birkwoodbrae Ellinor had
felt mortified, even insulted, on finding
that Sir Redmond, after the night of the
frustrated elopement, made no sign that
he remembered her existence; but the
moment she saw him the barriers she had
mentally raised between them fell at once,
and she no more sought, as she had done
of late, to erase him from her heart.
</p>

<p>
Poor foolish Ellinor!
</p>

<p>
'I had ever a hope,' said Sleath,
caressing her, 'that I would come upon you
suddenly again, and take you by surprise
with the earnestness and passion of my
love; and, Ellinor, the time has
come&mdash;thank heaven, the time has come!'
</p>

<p>
And he cast his eyes upward and sighed
sentimentally to the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
'An age seems to have elapsed since
that night,' he added.
</p>

<p>
'I was at the appointed place,'
said Ellinor, softly, and colouring deeply.
</p>

<p>
'So was I,' said Sir Redmond.
</p>

<p>
'And why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Did I not appear, you would ask?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;though perhaps it was as well
not now.'
</p>

<p>
'I was pinned by the leg by that
accursed brute of your sister's.'
</p>

<p>
'Jack.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n him&mdash;yes!  Pardon me; but
there was something grotesque, humiliating,
and exasperating in the whole
episode.'
</p>

<p>
'I was certain it was thus; but&mdash;but
why did you never write to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Never write to you!' exclaimed Sleath,
with well-feigned surprise; 'you
left&mdash;what's its name&mdash;Birkwoodbrae&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Early in September.'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly&mdash;that is the reason you did
not get my letters.'
</p>

<p>
'You wrote, then?' exclaimed Ellinor,
her soft face brightening with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'A score of letters, and they were all
returned to me from the Post Office,' replied
Sleath, unblushingly.
</p>

<p>
So Ellinor thought, 'I have wronged
him; it was but a short time ago since
this man loved me passionately, and so he
must love me still.  No love worthy of the
name would die in a couple of months.'
</p>

<p>
'I always wrote in fear, too, dearest
Ellinor.'
</p>

<p>
'Fear of whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Of your sister&mdash;of that old devil-dodger
Wodrow, that sly, spying fellow Colville&mdash;my
uncle, too, who is ailing still, but
whose wealth will all be ours&mdash;ours,
Ellinor!  In my heart of hearts I have
ever looked forward to the time when&mdash;on
finding one who loved me truly&mdash;I should
settle down into a quiet life and be happy,
in a cottage near a wood, and all that sort
of thing if necessary, my wants are so
few&mdash;so simple; but that is not required; we
shall have a mansion in Belgravia, a moor
in the Highlands, a bog in Ireland for the
snipe shooting, a place in the Midlands,
and a yacht at Cowes, and heaven only
knows all what more&mdash;when my uncle dies.'
</p>

<p>
And as he folded her caressingly to his
heart and nestled her face in his neck, the
poor little fool believed every word he
uttered; and then Sleath began to talk to
her of that dangerous and fascinating
past&mdash;the days of their early meeting among
the Birks of Invermay.
</p>

<p>
Even while caressing and fondling her,
his practised eye took in the whole details
of the room in which they were seated,
with its furniture and appurtenances.
There was an air of poverty&mdash;even
meanness&mdash;he thought (for his eye was
accustomed to luxury and splendour) within the
place, and this, with the ugly and sordid
prospect without, as seen through the
windows, encouraged him greatly in his
insolent and daring projects.
</p>

<p>
He would try again to carry off the girl
somehow&mdash;anyhow and without delay.
Who was to punish him, or who was there
to protect her?
</p>

<p>
That 'cousin' story of Colville's was, of
course, all bosh!  The very circumstance
of her residence in such a place as
Paddington proved it to be so.
</p>

<p>
By a man of his address and past
experience in all manner of worldly rascality,
her timidity, coyness, or scruples must, he
thought, be eventually overcome.  He had
entered stakes on the race; he would not
readily drop out of the hunt&mdash;the pursuit
of a helpless girl; if it did not redound to
his credit, it would at least afford him
pleasure, and if successful would flatter
his vanity, for her beauty was undoubted.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, he strangely felt somewhat
revengeful for the trouble she had already
given him, and to this sentiment the
downfall of her pride and the destruction, if
possible, of her delicacy and purity of
nature would be soothing to his spirit.
</p>

<p>
Even amid his caresses and love-making
there was an easy insolence in his manner,
born of his innate and perverse vulgarity
of race and nature, and encouraged by the
girl's unprotected condition, without
parents or brothers; but it was so veiled
that poor Ellinor never suspected it till he
said, with something of irritation in his
manner,
</p>

<p>
'As for the old devil-dodger, we do not
require his consent now, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Who&mdash;what?' asked Ellinor, with perplexity.
</p>

<p>
'Doctor Wodrow&mdash;the psalm-singing
old beggar.'
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak of him so irreverently,'
said Ellinor, imploringly; 'he made a pet
of me from my infancy, and I love him as
if he was my father.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh,' said Sir Redmond, jealously, 'and
his son, too, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'How can you speak to me thus?' asked
Ellinor, as the agonised face of the young
hussar she had seen in the park came
upbraidingly before her.  How little Sleath
knew or appreciated the depth of her pure,
innocent, and dreamy nature, albeit that,
through fanning her ambition, he had
taught her to be false to Robert Wodrow.
</p>

<p>
After a pause, resuming his softest tone,
he said, while holding her hands in his,
and looking fondly and admiringly down
into her soft hazel eyes,
</p>

<p>
'Then, dearest, you will, as before,
consent to a private marriage?'
</p>

<p>
'If Mary will give me permission,'
replied Ellinor, slowly and with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'Mary&mdash;is she your keeper?'
</p>

<p>
'She is my dear and only sister.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;but will she accord her permission?'
</p>

<p>
'I can only hope so.'
</p>

<p>
'If not?'
</p>

<p>
'Then we can but wait.'
</p>

<p>
'My uncle's death, for he will never
consent.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a sad event to look forward to.'
</p>

<p>
'Very,' replied Sleath, with difficulty
repressing a smile; 'but I cannot wait.'
</p>

<p>
'There must be no running away&mdash;no
attempt at eloping again,' said Ellinor,
firmly.
</p>

<p>
Sir Redmond thought of Jack's teeth,
and looked nervously and furtively about
him.
</p>

<p>
'Jack is with Mary,' said Ellinor, who
detected the glance.
</p>

<p>
'As you will&mdash;what you please, darling,
so that you'll be mine.  I'll see a
sky-pilot&mdash;I mean a clergyman&mdash;on the subject,'
he added, thinking that, after a little
coaching, Gaiters might officiate in that
capacity; but then how about the registrar
and a church?  'Well, that is agreed
upon, and we shall soon be one.'
</p>

<p>
To change the subject for a time, that
he might consider the further development
of his nefarious scheme,
</p>

<p>
'How on earth did you come to select
such a queer locality as this to reside in?'
asked Sleath, looking with genuine
surprise at the humble but neat apartment,
where, however, there were now many
traces of ladies' hands and work.
</p>

<p>
'It was a chance.  We were, and are,
so ignorant of London.'
</p>

<p>
'And your landlady&mdash;you have one, I
suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Is the kindest, most attentive, and
dearest old thing; not that she is very old
either.  And she has seen better days, it
would seem.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.  I never knew a landlady
who had not.  And so she is kind to you?'
</p>

<p>
'And to Mary&mdash;unvaryingly so.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, I must thank her for all this.'
</p>

<p>
'Here she comes to lay the tea things.
Mrs. Fubsby,' said Ellinor, as the latter
entered the room, 'this is the gentleman
who bought&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Fubsby!' interrupted Sleath, in a
dismayed tone.  'What the devil&mdash;Seraphina
Fubsby!'
</p>

<p>
'Gentleman!' shrieked Mrs. Fubsby, letting
her tray fall crash with all its contents
on the floor.  'Villain! double-dyed
villain, do we meet again&mdash;again after all
these years?'
</p>

<p>
'She is mad!' said he, starting to his
feet and keeping the table between herself
and him.
</p>

<p>
'This is Sir Redmond Sleath!' exclaimed
Ellinor, in tones of terror and explanation.
</p>

<p>
'The same man who married me under
the name of Redmond, and then deserted
me in France.  My husband at last, after
all these years of cruel desertion.'
</p>

<p>
'Your husband?' said Ellinor, in a voice
like a husky whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and look at the white-faced craven.
He does not deny it.  Listen, Miss Ellinor,
though what has brought him here I know
not.  No good, you maybe assured.  I was
waiting-maid to Lady Dunkeld in Paris
when he and I became acquainted on the
Boulevards, and he married me under the
name of Redmond.'
</p>

<p>
'You married me, you mean, or thought
you did, you artful and accursed Jezebel,'
exclaimed Sleath, choking with rage.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what is all this I hear?' moaned
Ellinor, overwhelmed with horror, dismay,
and humiliation.
</p>

<p>
'The bitter truth, young lady,' said
Mrs. Fubsby, beginning partly to take in
the situation.
</p>

<p>
'You have no proofs now of what you
say, you infernal Jezebel, who in your
maturer years entrapped me in my
boyhood!' thundered Sleath.
</p>

<p>
'No proofs!'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;the old devil-dodger&mdash;the curé
who performed the ceremony, as I suppose
you will call it, was shot in the days of the Commune.'
</p>

<p>
'True, but the records of his chapel
still exist.'
</p>

<p>
'What is all this to me?'
</p>

<p>
'You will soon learn to your cost, now
that I have discovered you under your
true name.'
</p>

<p>
As related, Mrs. Fubsby (who had
resumed her maiden name) was not without
personal attraction; but she was wasted in
aspect, though only about forty&mdash;perhaps
forty-five&mdash;years of age; and now her dark
eyes were ablaze with rage and grief.
Thus she spoke the truth when she said,
</p>

<p>
'I was a pretty young woman, Miss
Ellinor, when I first met this wretch in
human form; but disappointment, disgust,
neglect, and shame, too, have all made me
what I seem now&mdash;old-looking, wasted, and blasted!'
</p>

<p>
At this crisis Robert Wodrow came
upon the scene.  Entering abruptly and
unannounced, he regarded the trio with
extreme bewilderment.  He saw
Mrs. Fubsby, whom he knew not, convulsed
with just indignation; Ellinor in tears on
a sofa, her bowed face hidden in her
hands, her whole air that of one completely
crushed, and sitting gathered in a heap, as
it were; while Sleath, pale with rage, spite,
and baffled knavery, was about to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
Robert Wodrow never stopped to make
any inquiry.  He could only conceive one
thing&mdash;that Ellinor had been somehow
insulted or wronged.  All the jealousy,
fury, and hatred that had so long swelled
in his heart now gushed up in fiercer heat,
and, endued with thrice his usual strength
thereby, he sprang upon Sleath, grasped
him by the collar behind, and, with many
a kick and heavy lash of his riding-switch
thrust him from the room, down the stair,
and headlong into the street, where by one
final impetus from his foot he flung him in
a half breathless heap by the kerbstone,
and then closed the house door.
</p>

<p>
Gathering himself up quickly, Sleath
hastened away, registering a truly infernal
vow of vengeance&mdash;a vow all the deeper
that it was unuttered.
</p>

<p>
Thus had light been suddenly and
luridly thrown on the great secret of his
life&mdash;the secret which prevented him from
raising his eyes to Blanche Galloway, as
stated in the fifth chapter of our first
volume&mdash;which he dared not do as a married
man.
</p>

<p>
He was decidedly unfortunate in his
views regarding Ellinor Wellwood; and
now the daughter of Nox&mdash;inevitable
Nemesis&mdash;had overtaken him!
</p>

<p>
Panting with exertion, and with
something of a grim laugh, Robert Wodrow
returned to the room, muttering to himself,
</p>

<p>
'He'll not forget that last kick with my
regulation boot, in the region of the <i>os
coccygis</i>.  By Jove, I haven't forgotten my
Quain and Turner!  And now to find out
what all this was about.'
</p>

<p>
We need scarcely say that Ellinor's
soul almost died within her at the
contemplation of the two narrow escapes she had
from ruin and despair!
</p>

<p>
Robert Wodrow literally ground his
teeth when he heard of all that had just
transpired.
</p>

<p>
He looked worn and haggard, and amid
her own mortification Ellinor's heart bled
for him, for she knew that his life had
been crushed by her; while she was ever
to him
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'His love that loved him so,<br />
  His love who loved him years ago.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'I don't think, Ellinor, said he, 'that
even in my dear old governor's "Analecta"
would he find a quotation suitable to this
fellow's rascality; but I agree with Calvin
and Knox in their views of some men.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'That they are born to be damned, and
this fellow Sleath is one of them.'
</p>

<p>
'If men or women are bad they often
become so through the faults of each other,'
said the landlady; 'but I'll bring my man
to book if there is law to be had in London.'
</p>

<p>
And now Mary arrived, accompanied by
her faithful four-footed friend, who
recognised Robert Wodrow, despite his hussar
uniform, and was profuse in his delight,
leaping almost to his face at times.
</p>

<p>
The minutes of this farewell interview
sped like lightning!
</p>

<p>
Robert Wodrow, without a thought of
himself, had always loved Ellinor in the
past, and he loved her still, 'for true love
can live even in despair,' says a writer;
but true love is scarce as the phœnix;
and he had for Ellinor, despite her ill-usage
of him, all the reverence that went out with
the age of chivalry.
</p>

<p>
'I am going far away,' said he, while
hot tears rolled over the cheeks of both
girls, and his own too; 'and when we
meet again, if ever&mdash;if ever, Ellinor&mdash;we
shall both be old and cold perhaps&mdash;old in
experience, and&mdash;thank God&mdash;cold in
heart&mdash;old and cold, and feeling none of the
bitterness of an hour like this!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few days after the public prints
announced the departure of the Hussars for
India, and the sisters thought sadly that,
too probably, never would they see or hear
of Robert Wodrow again.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
MRS. DEROUBIGNE.
</h3>

<p>
The advent of Sleath, and perhaps the
influence she had upon the life of Robert
Wodrow, had a crushing effect upon the
overwrought nervous system of Ellinor.
She was again ill&mdash;ailing with something
mental rather than bodily&mdash;and many little
comforts were necessary for her, thus
taxing Mary's slender exchequer sorely, and
adding to her anxieties.
</p>

<p>
Colville had passed out of the life of
the latter, but not quite out of her
thoughts.  He was going to India&mdash;she
had heard him say so.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he was already gone.  So far
as the newspapers were concerned, she
had seen no notice of his marriage to
Blanche Galloway, an engagement with
whom he had so distinctly disavowed.
</p>

<p>
For a moment vanity whispered to
Mary's heart, was he going far away that
he might forget herself?
</p>

<p>
In this idea she was, perhaps, nearer
the truth than she knew.  Her first and
only love affair&mdash;if such it really
was&mdash;had been a dream, and she thought,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Life and the world and mine own self are changed<br />
  For a dream's sake.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And Colville might, to a great extent,
have applied the quotation to himself, as
we may soon show.
</p>

<p>
Times there were when Mary thought
bitterly, 'Why did he teach me to love
him, and then neglect me so?  It was
cruel, cruel!  I was so happy and content
till he came.'
</p>

<p>
And often did this idea haunt her while
she taught her little pupils to play the
sweet, low 'Birks of Invermay.'  But ere
long a shock awaited her.
</p>

<p>
On leaving the house of these pupils
one day near Portman Square, she incidentally
saw, when taking her parasol off
the hall table, the visiting-cards of Lady
Dunkeld and the Hon. Blanche Galloway
lying there, and a thrill, a presentiment of
coming evil, filled her heart; this emotion
was verified when, on calling next day, a
brief note was handed to her, enclosing a
little cheque, with the blunt information
that her services were dispensed with.
</p>

<p>
Her name had by some means caught
the ears of these malevolent ones, and
this, she knew, was the result of their
influence and enmity; and, gentle though
her nature, a rush of anger and disgust,
not unmingled with dismay, filled her heart.
</p>

<p>
How was she to break this new calamity
to poor ailing Ellinor&mdash;the tidings of her
rude dismissal?  And, loth to return
to her home, she wandered through the
streets for a time in aimless misery.
</p>

<p>
To add to the gloom of her spirit, it
was a foggy November afternoon, and she
felt the most intense depression, all the
more so that she was as yet unaccustomed
to the breathless atmosphere, or rather
want of atmosphere&mdash;peculiar to London
generally, and never so much as in that
season&mdash;the month of death, as the French
call it.
</p>

<p>
Walking onward in the aimless way
described, she found herself at the end of
Upper Brook Street, where it opens into
Grosvenor Square, and there a lady was
stepping from her carriage before one of
the stately mansions.  Mary, full of her
own sad thoughts, nearly jostled her, and,
pausing, apologised.
</p>

<p>
The lady, a tall and handsome woman,
paused too, and Mary recognised
Mrs. Deroubigne, who had complimented her
upon her playing, and spoken so kindly to
her at Lady Dunkeld's dance; and
something pleading and pathetic in Mary's
whole air and face now made Mrs. Deroubigne
regard her attentively for a moment.
</p>

<p>
'We have met before,' said she.  'You
are the young lady I had the pleasure of
hearing play at Number 60, Park Lane?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Mrs. Deroubigne,' replied Mary,
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'You know my name!'
</p>

<p>
'I heard it mentioned incidentally, and
the kindness of your manner made it
dwell in my memory.'
</p>

<p>
'You look both pale and ill, my dear,'
said the lady; 'come in, and let me give
you a glass of wine&mdash;it will do you good.'
</p>

<p>
Mary thought of Lady Dunkeld, with
whom she had last seen this lady, and,
pausing, muttered her thanks, and accepted
the invitation, but hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
Little could she foresee that her whole
future life hinged&mdash;if we may use the
old parliamentary expression&mdash;upon that
chance meeting with Mrs. Deroubigne!
</p>

<p>
The latter would not, we may be assured&mdash;for
she was very aristocratic in her
tastes and proclivities&mdash;have noticed an
ordinary 'person,' young or old, employed
to furnish music for any dance she had
been at; but there was something so
sweet and pathetic, as stated, in Mary's
face and manner&mdash;more than all, something
so perfectly ladylike in her bearing,
that Mrs. Deroubigne felt attracted towards her.
</p>

<p>
Mary did not get the proffered wine a
moment too late; so much was she
overcome, mentally and bodily, by the bitter
mortification to which she had that day
been subjected, that the stately drawing-room
in which she found herself seemed
to be whirling round her.
</p>

<p>
'As you know my name, my dear,' said
Mrs. Deroubigne, 'may I inquire yours?'
</p>

<p>
'Mary Wellwood.'
</p>

<p>
The lady's colour changed a little.
</p>

<p>
'Wellwood?' she repeated; 'that name
was very familiar to me once.  I knew a
captain&mdash;latterly he was colonel&mdash;Wellwood,
who left the Army, and went to
reside near Invermay in Scotland.  Perhaps
he was a relation?'
</p>

<p>
'He was my dear father,' replied Mary,
in a broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed&mdash;your father!  He was my dearest friend.'
</p>

<p>
How very dear he had been to her once,
the old lady did not say then; but thereby
hung a tale!
</p>

<p>
'Your face seemed strangely familiar to
me,' she said, while regarding Mary with
tender interest, and patting her hand as
she held it between her two.  'Your father
is dead?'
</p>

<p>
'And mamma too, otherwise I might not
have been reduced to accept the
occupation in which you found me.'
</p>

<p>
'This is sad&mdash;very sad!' said
Mrs. Deroubigne, her eyes suffusing as she
spoke.  'Your father, I repeat, was the
dearest friend of my girlhood&mdash;how long,
long it seems ago now&mdash;my dear girl,
I might have been your mother, and for
his sake I should like to act as one to
you now.'
</p>

<p>
Mary's heart went forth to the speaker,
and then she thought of Ellinor.  The
words of Mrs. Deroubigne came as a kind
of revelation to her; she had heard a
rumour of some old and early love affair
of her father's, which had led to the bitter
family quarrel referred to in the first
chapters of our story.
</p>

<p>
'And you knew mamma?' asked Mary,
wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'Well, indeed; she was the queen of
our regiment and the belle of every town
where it was quartered.  I can say so
now, when I am old and widowed.'
</p>

<p>
'Ellinor is thought very like her.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is Ellinor?'
</p>

<p>
'My only sister.'
</p>

<p>
'If so, she must be very handsome.
And are there only you two left in the
world?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Mary; and little by little
Mrs. Deroubigne, with growing commiseration,
elicited from her some information
about herself and sister&mdash;their plans and
hopes in coming to London; and on
hearing them she muttered something about
her own 'two little girls,' as if comparingly,
and shook her head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deroubigne was evidently a very
charming woman, who had seen much of
the world, and as a friend and companion
was clever and delightful.  After a little
pause, she said, suddenly,
</p>

<p>
'Of course you know your cousin, Captain
Wellwood, of the Scots Guards?'
</p>

<p>
'Only by name, and an unfortunate reputation.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I forgot&mdash;there was a family
quarrel.  He is one of my dearest
friends&mdash;Leslie Wellwood Colville, as he calls
himself now.'
</p>

<p>
'Wellwood&mdash;Colville!' said Mary, inquiringly.
'I beg your pardon, Mrs. Deroubigne,
but are there <i>two</i> officers of that
name in the Scots Guards?'
</p>

<p>
'No, only one&mdash;Wellwood, who added
Colville to his name as successor to a large
property&mdash;your cousin, in fact&mdash;and the
peerage he claims, Lord Colville of Ochiltree.'
</p>

<p>
A light seemed to break on Mary; she
knew not what to think; she had no voice
to reply.  She felt that she changed
colour, while a sudden dryness came over her
lips and tongue.
</p>

<p>
She heard the door-bell ring, and knew
that Mrs. Deroubigne was speaking again,
yet scarcely understood what she said.
</p>

<p>
'He starts for India in a day or two,
and is to lunch with me this afternoon.
To meet you&mdash;a cousin so charming&mdash;will
be quite a little surprise for him; and here
he comes!' she added, as the door was
opened, and Colville&mdash;the identical Colville
of Birkwoodbrae&mdash;was ushered in!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
WAS IT NOT A DREAM?
</h3>

<p>
He came forward through the long
drawing-room with his usual easy bearing, his
head well set up, his military air, and
calm, unflinching eyes, which dilated on
seeing Mary Wellwood, and then he
paused.
</p>

<p>
For fully a minute there was dead
silence&mdash;the silence of dumb bewilderment,
and Mary felt how loudly and painfully
her heart was beating; while to both
Colville and Mrs. Deroubigne it was apparent
how much she was agitated, thereby
involving a secret which the latter was yet
to learn.
</p>

<p>
Mary had felt that she had cause to be
indignant and to feign indifference.  As
the lover who had trifled with her, as she
thought, and gone to the very verge of a
declaration or proposal, and then paused,
and he&mdash;the obnoxious cousin, the heir of
entail, one and the same person&mdash;stood
before her, in her eyes of deep violet blue
there came for a brief space the light of a
sudden determination, with something of
a horrified stare; but ere Mrs. Deroubigne
could approach an explanation or
introduction, Colville sprang towards the pale
and trembling girl, and took both her
hands within his own.
</p>

<p>
'Mary&mdash;Mary Wellwood!' he exclaimed,
in a voice full of passion and pathos; 'you
here!&mdash;and do we meet again after all?
What mystery is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Probably a portion of that which seems
to have involved all your actions of late,'
replied Mary, with the slightest <i>soupçon</i> of
hauteur in her manner, while with difficulty
restraining her tears.
</p>

<p>
'But are you not glad to see me again&mdash;you
whom I loved, and love with all my
heart?'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Colville,' said Mary, attempting,
but in vain, to withdraw her hands,
'this painful and degrading mode of
treating me must not to be resumed!'
</p>

<p>
'Painful and degrading?  Mary, you
know that I love you.'
</p>

<p>
'You never told me so.  I wish I had
never seen you, or that I were dead!'
exclaimed Mary, a little incoherently, while
averting her face, and feeling her
determination giving way.
</p>

<p>
'Never told you so&mdash;but you knew; and
we were interrupted when we parted last;
and then I met with that accident, the
wound in my right hand, which prevented
me from writing or going to Birkwoodbrae
in time to prevent you and Ellinor from
vanishing, without trace, as you did.'
</p>

<p>
By this time she had wrenched her
hands away, and, thinking with alarm and
dismay of how Mrs. Deroubigne might
view this singular scene, she covered her
face with them.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Colville!' she exclaimed, with
a tone of expostulation, as he gently pulled
them down, while triumph and joy sparkled
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Now, don't look vexed with me any
more,' said he, in a tone of tender
entreaty, while kissing her hands.  'My dear,
dear cousin&mdash;dearer than all the world
to me,' he added, as the mingled expression
of indignation, perplexity, and doubt
passed out of her sweet, pale face; 'let me
explain all, and tell you how I love you!'
</p>

<p>
Mary was so shaken by all she had
lately undergone that she could only weep
now; thus for a moment or two she
yielded to him; he pressed her to his
heart, and covered her eyes and lips with
fast-falling kisses, forgetful of the
presence of Mrs. Deroubigne, who looked
laughingly on.  The good old lady seemed
to like the romance of the situation, and
of the episode she had so unwittingly
brought about.
</p>

<p>
'And how is Ellinor?' he asked, as Mary
drew blushingly back towards their hostess.
</p>

<p>
'Far from well.  Of late she has suffered
much&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Through my folly?'
</p>

<p>
'And other matters too.'
</p>

<p>
Mary felt her poor little head in a whirl,
with some difficulty recognising the whole
situation.
</p>

<p>
So the Colville she had learned to love
and her cousin Wellwood were one and
the same person!  Thus, much which had
puzzled her on many occasions in the
bearing of Dr. Wodrow was accounted for
now.  They had been in the plot together.
Many things that had seemed perplexing
and strange were now clear as day.  She
recalled the initials, and the mystery he
made about the W that stood for the
middle name, and remembered that she
had seen the Wellwood crest&mdash;a demi-lion&mdash;on
his signet ring; nay, it was on it
now!  She recalled, with some shame and
bewilderment, all her sharp and antagonistic
utterances about him and his father,
and she cast down her long dark lashes as
these things came to memory.
</p>

<p>
And so it was of himself he had spoken,
and to himself he had referred, as having
been the worse for wine in the cantonments
at Lahore; himself he had referred
to as being 'not a half bad fellow,' and
being wounded in action with the hill
tribes; himself on whose supposed coldness
and selfishness he heard her descant;
and it was regard for her as a beautiful
and friendless girl, with the charming tie
of cousinship hitherto unknown, that had
inspired him as he stood with her side by
side at her parents' grave!
</p>

<p>
'I knew not what love really was till I
knew you, Mary,' said he, caressing her
again.  'In the world I live and move in,
I never thought it would touch me as it
did, for there money seeks money or rank.
Out of novels and plays, I doubted its
existence; but I have learned the sweet
lesson at last, and you&mdash;the dear cousin
who loathed my very name&mdash;were my
preceptor, Mary!'
</p>

<p>
'But why&mdash;oh, why all this mystery&mdash;this
concealment of your real position,
name, and relationship?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask me, after what I have
said?  I wanted to know you thoroughly,
after all Dr. Wodrow had told me about
you and Ellinor.  I then wanted you to
love me, not as the owner of a landed
estate&mdash;not as a lounging Guardsman&mdash;not
for the pretty woods of Birkwoodbrae,
that I could perhaps give to you, and
would have done so had they not been
entailed; but, like the hero of a romance,
Mary, for myself alone.'
</p>

<p>
'And now to lunch, dears,' said
Mrs. Deroubigne, as she laughingly kissed
Mary.  'I am tired of playing the part of
Gooseberry.'
</p>

<p>
How much they had to talk about, to
describe, to explain to each other, out of
all the cross-purposes, confusion, and pain
that had arisen from her cousin's scheme,
the little romance he had concocted, and
the end of which he had not foreseen;
while, worse than all, but for the doctrine
of chances, they might never have met
again!
</p>

<p>
He heard with astonishment of the two
episodes of Lady Dunkeld's dance and
Westminster Abbey.
</p>

<p>
'To think that I should be so near you,
and have no consciousness of your
presence!' he exclaimed.  'Where were my
eyes&mdash;where was my heart?  My poor
little Mary, had you only thought of
looking in the Army List, you would there
have seen that your wicked cousin and
Leslie Colville were one and the same
man!'
</p>

<p>
The astonishment of the latter, on
hearing of the recent cruel conduct of Lady
Dunkeld and her daughter, was only
equalled by his just indignation.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, for the rarity of Christian charity!'
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'I can forgive them <i>now</i>,' said Mary, in
a tremulous voice, and with a swift, bright
glance at Leslie Colville.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot,' said he; 'forgiveness is
indifference, or nearly so, but no one can
quite forgive a wrong like this.  But I
see the origin of this hostility to one who
was helpless against it.  When I think
how&mdash;as you know, my dear Mrs. Deroubigne&mdash;how
that half-French brat, Blanche
Galloway, in her flirty, Continental way,
has sung to me, played at me, talked
to me, and made œillades, I am disgusted.'
</p>

<p>
'Come now, Captain Colville,' said
Mrs. Deroubigne, 'that is scarcely fair; did you
not encourage her a little <i>à la soldat</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all!  She was ever admiring
the rose or flower I had in my button-hole,
and when I begged her acceptance thereof,
it duly figured in her bosom or hair afterwards,
while she flattered herself, no doubt,
in the depths of her French imaginings&mdash;but
I shall teach these Dunkelds a sharp
lesson ere I go.'
</p>

<p>
'Now that you talk of it&mdash;and now
especially&mdash;I do not see why you should
go to the East at all,' said Mrs. Deroubigne,
while Mary grew paler than before,
and felt as if roused from a startling
dream.
</p>

<p>
'True, true, but needs must now.  In
sorrow for the loss of Mary, I volunteered
for special service abroad; and so I find
her but to lose her again,' exclaimed
Colville.
</p>

<p>
'Special service!' she asked, in a strange
voice.  'What is that?'
</p>

<p>
'It means detached for staff work where&mdash;where
operations are in progress,' said
he, evasively.
</p>

<p>
'Speak to the point, Captain Colville,'
said Mrs. Deroubigne.  'You go to the
north-west frontier of India.'
</p>

<p>
'India!' repeated Mary, with whitening
lips.  'Has life so little joy for you?'
</p>

<p>
'It had but little till within this hour,
dearest Mary.'
</p>

<p>
'Can you not withdraw your application?'
said Mrs. Deroubigne.
</p>

<p>
'As a soldier's widow, you should know
that, unless overtaken by illness, I could
not do so with honour.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right.  How unfortunate it is!'
</p>

<p>
'So, my darling and I have met but to
part again.'
</p>

<p>
Mary heard all this with more dismay
than she dared exhibit just then, or trust
herself to speak about, and it was with a
mingled sense of joy she found herself
pledged, before Mrs. Deroubigne, to be
Leslie Colville's future wife, and saw
flashing on her engaged finger the same
diamond ring he had brought for her acceptance
on that eventful day at Birkwoodbrae,
for then, as now, Mary Wellwood was the
one woman in the world for him.  'Whether
our passion be prudent,' says Hawley
Smart, 'whether the woman we have asked
to tread life's path with us is likely to be
approved in our maturer years, we reck
little.  She is the one woman, so far as we
are concerned just now, and has she not
pledged herself to be so always?'
</p>

<p>
But no doubt of himself or of his choice
came into the heart of Colville.  She had
already been tried like gold in the fire;
and he was yet to be further tried to an
extent he little expected.
</p>

<p>
When the time came to depart, Mary
left Mrs. Deroubigne with a heart too full
of regard and gratitude for utterance in
words.  She could only sob on her ample
and motherly breast; and Colville, when
conveying her in a cab to that home which
he had resolved she must change for one
more suitable, heard of its locality with
sorrow and dismay, and with emotions
very different from those of Sir Redmond
Sleath when he obtained the address of
Ellinor.
</p>

<p>
'Paddington&mdash;Paddington Green!  My
Heaven, how came you to select such a
place?' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Through the guard of the train.  We
asked his advice,' replied Mary, simply.
</p>

<p>
'This is intolerable!  Such a hole&mdash;such
a den&mdash;such a locality!  You must quit it
without delay,' he added, as the only homes
he knew were in Mayfair, Tyburnia, and
Belgravia: and though his heart was full
of joy the first genuine laugh that escaped
him was when he heard the address he was
to inquire for.
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Seraphina Fubsby!  Good heavens,
where did she pick up such a name?'
</p>

<p>
Mary had no time then to inform him
that the good woman was fully entitled to
another.  She was too full of her own
thoughts, and, though the fog of that
horrible London November day had deepened
and darkened all around her, in her
heart there seemed sunshine now!
</p>

<p>
Could it be that so much had passed&mdash;that
events to her so momentous had
occurred&mdash;since she had turned away in
gloom and almost in despair from the
great door of that house near Portman
Square, afraid even to tell and crush poor
Ellinor's heart by tidings of the new
misfortune that had overtaken them?
</p>

<p>
Was it not all a dream, from which she
would awake to a world of bitterness?
</p>

<p>
But, no.  Leslie Colville's betrothal ring
was on her finger; his strong, firm and
loving hand was clasping hers; and all
about her was truth and reality.
</p>

<p>
'What tidings I bring, dear Ellinor!' she
thought, as the cab stopped at the door of
their humble abode, and Leslie Colville
sprang out to assist her to alight as they
heard Jack's bark of welcome.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
GOING TO THE FRONT.
</h3>

<p>
So they were solemnly engaged at last,
plighted to each other, these cousins, and
to be married; but when?  For Colville
had now to face the perils of the war in
Afghanistan ere that event could come to
pass.
</p>

<p>
He was going straight and almost
immediately to the scene of strife among the
savage passes there, and for Mary to
accompany him was impossible just then,
and as Ellinor could not be left alone she
would have to go too; so the idea was not
considered for a moment.
</p>

<p>
They could but wait the future in trust
and hope, and amid the brief joy of the
present time was a dread of that future,
for he who was departing might never&mdash;<i>return</i>.
</p>

<p>
'All is unchanged at Birkwoodbrae, and
old Elspat is there in charge, dearest Mary,'
said Colville, 'so you and Ellinor may
return if you will, and live there till I come
back from the East.'
</p>

<p>
The temptation to do so was strong&mdash;the
crave to be at home again, to see the
faces of old friends, the dear familiar hills,
the silver birks, and the fast-flowing May.
But though understanding each other fully
as the cousins did now, and though their
positions as such were changed and
strengthened, Mary in her independence
of spirit and character thought she would
prefer to struggle on as they were, till he
could take her there as his wife.
</p>

<p>
For her kindness to the sisters, Colville
slipped quietly into Mrs. Fubsby's hand a
cheque for an ample sum, saying, after he
had heard her story, that it would help
her in her plans to prove herself Lady
Sleath and punish her wrong-doer.
</p>

<p>
This was on the following day, when
Mary told him the simple story of all their
recent troubles, while he gazed down upon
her with eyes full of truth and tenderness,
and her heart was beating tumultuously
with its new-found joy.  She knew that
he loved her now, he whom she felt inclined
to adore.
</p>

<p>
Yet the future seemed to loom darkly
before her.  There was this terrible
campaign in Afghanistan, with its certain and
far separation, its remote and fearful
contingencies to be faced, endured, and
undergone; so Fate seemed still to be cruel to her.
</p>

<p>
When, in broken accents and with
mingled emotions of anger and shame,
while her head reclined upon his breast,
Mary told Colville of Sir Redmond Sleath's
systematic attempts, though secretly
married, to lure away her unsuspecting sister
Ellinor, great was the wrath and fury of
her lover.
</p>

<p>
Whip in hand, he would assuredly have
taken condign vengeance on the back and
limbs of the parvenu baronet, but that the
latter had to quit London&mdash;even England&mdash;just
about that time, in some haste and
in dire disgrace.
</p>

<p>
At his club he had gambled deeply with
Lord Dunkeld and others, from whom he
had won great sums of money&mdash;more than
the peer especially could well afford&mdash;and
before it was discovered that his wonderful
success was due to the use of <i>marked</i> cards.
</p>

<p>
During a game of <i>quinze</i> one of the
players&mdash;a brother-Guardsman of Colville's&mdash;noticed
that several of the cards were in
some way indicated, and, after a careful
examination, it was found that all the fives
and the court cards were marked by the
prick of a needle at the corners, and some
in the centre, too.
</p>

<p>
These marks, though almost invisible to
the eye, were recognisable by the sense of
touch.  A storm of indignation burst over
Sleath.  He was flung down the club
stairs, had to eat very 'humble pie' indeed,
and was now gone to the Continent, none
knew or cared precisely where, with a
congenial friend, Mr. Adolphus Dewsnap
(of whom more anon); so whatever legal
plans Mrs. Fubsby meant to adopt to
relinquish her maiden name and insist upon
the adoption of that of Lady Sleath, were
partially frustrated or delayed for a time
by the baronet's disappearance.
</p>

<p>
On the very day after the engagement,
Mary and Ellinor bade her farewell&mdash;it
could scarcely be said with regret, though
the good woman shed abundance of tears
on the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Colville, who resented as absurd and
<i>infra dig.</i> Mary's desire of maintaining
herself and adding to the slender
patrimony their father had left them, brought
an invitation from Mrs. Deroubigne, in
whose care they were to be left for the
future&mdash;certainly for a time at least; and
she received them with open arms, and a
welcome all the more warm that she was
just then alone, her two little daughters
being absent at a boarding establishment;
and, amid the new comforts and ease that
surrounded her in Grosvenor Square, Mary
forgot for a time the old wish of her heart
to go 'home,' as she ever considered
Birkwoodbrae her home.
</p>

<p>
At the commencement of the present
century, Malcolm says 'that this square is
the very <i>focus</i> of feudal grandeur, religion,
fashion, taste, and hospitality, and that
the novel-reader must be intimately
acquainted with the description of residents
within it, when the words "Grosvenor
Square" are to be found in almost every
work of that species written in the compass
of fifty years past.'
</p>

<p>
Before the house of Mrs. Deroubigne
were still to be seen iron link-extinguishers,
a remnant of the past, when links were
carried before carriages at the West-End
till 1807.  Though old-fashioned, the
mansion was a lofty and stately one; and
Mary, when she gazed upon the tall
windows on the spacious square and the
landscape garden in the centre, with its
old trees planted by Kent, wondered if she
was the same Mary Wellwood who for so
many weeks past had contemplated the
frowsy view from the windows of her late
abode.
</p>

<p>
In her regard for Colville, and inspired
no doubt by memories of the past and the
dead, Mrs. Deroubigne, to do her justice,
was unwavering in her kindness and
hospitality to her new friends; and times
there were when she actually, amid her
dream-thoughts, seemed to forget her own
married life, and her heart yearned, warmly
and strangely, to the two orphan girls of
her old lover&mdash;the girls who might, she
averred laughingly, have been her own
daughters, had fate so arranged it.
</p>

<p>
'Your face, Mary, always reminds me
of your father,' she would say, taking the
girl's dimpled cheeks caressingly between
her hands; 'but yours, Ellinor, suggests
to me more of your mamma&mdash;you have
the same dreamy hazel eyes.  And you are
romantic, no doubt?' she added, with a
fond smile.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps; every girl has, it is said, at
least one romance in the course of her
life,' said Ellinor, thinking of poor Robert
Wodrow and the wretched Sleath.
</p>

<p>
'And, certainly, I have had mine!' said
Mrs. Deroubigne, kissing Mary, while old
memories floated through her mind, known
and clear to herself alone.
</p>

<p>
Mary thought that though it might be
delightful in summer to visit Birkwoodbrae,
with Mrs. Deroubigne as a chaperone,
she would never go back to it as a
home on sufferance&mdash;on that she was
resolved; and until she was a wedded wife
she could but wait in hope, love, and
confidence; besides, Mrs. Deroubigne, at
Colville's suggestion, had a plan for a little
tour on the Continent to occupy some of
the time of his absence, and to make the
sisters forget some of the mortifications
they had recently undergone.
</p>

<p>
Though the temporary loss of Mary
and the mystery involving her movements&mdash;her
very fate after leaving Perthshire&mdash;had
so tortured the heart of Colville that
he had resolved to seek for change amid
the stirring scenes of Eastern war once
more, he felt that he could now leave
England with emotions of comparative
happiness and content.
</p>

<p>
He knew that she was in safety&mdash;surrounded
by every comfort, even by splendour&mdash;and
had been saved from much he
could not quite foresee, by the slender but
blessed chance of her meeting with
Mrs. Deroubigne!
</p>

<p>
To him and Mary the few meetings
before his departure seemed heaven-sent&mdash;though
a sorrowful separation was at
hand&mdash;the happiest of all their past
existence.
</p>

<p>
Neither seemed to question, as yet, how
they would feel or could exist during the
months&mdash;perhaps the more than year&mdash;of
separation that had to come.
</p>

<p>
Never, never would she forget the time
when he placed the engagement-ring upon
her engaged finger, and when their eyes
met in one long and deep glance&mdash;a
glance that, though no word was uttered,
proved the silent compact of his avowed
and her accepted love.
</p>

<p>
So the fatal day came inexorably at last;
after a farewell dinner to him at the
Guards' Club in Pall Mall.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye, dear girls,' said he, cheerily;
'good-bye, love Mary&mdash;another kiss and
another.  I'll bring you back such wonderful
things from India&mdash;tiger-skins, and
tiger claws set in gold; Delhi jewellery
from Chandney Chowk; ivory carvings,
and I know not what more,' he added, and,
in spite of himself, strove to be cheerful;
'and when I do come back, Mary, you will
be my own darling little wife till death
parts us.'
</p>

<p>
So the hour, the supreme moment, had
come at last, and Leslie Colville was gone!
</p>

<p>
His letters were Mary's only solace after
that; long letters full of loving and
passionate expression, to be read and re-read
again; from Suez, burning Aden, and
beautiful Bombay; they came regularly,
but became fewer and further between as
he proceeded up country by railway, and
his last, before they left London for the
Continent, informed her that he had been
appointed to the staff at Jellalabad, where
Sir Samuel Browne was concentrating his
forces prior to an advance on Cabul.  Thus
he would soon be going to the Front.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
AT JELLALABAD.
</h3>

<p>
'Well, Colville, how do you like India
from what you have seen of it?' asked
Colonel Spatterdash, as he sat smoking in
his shirt and pyjamas, for, though the
month was March, the solar heat was
already considerable in that part of
Afghanistan, and quite disagreeable by eight
in the morning.
</p>

<p>
'I don't like it at all,' replied Colville;
'besides, I have been in India before, and
you forget, colonel, that this is not India,
but rather beyond it.'
</p>

<p>
'True, I am not likely to forget that,
when the rocks are bristling with Afghan
juzails!  But, if you don't like it, what
the deuce brought you out now?'
</p>

<p>
'To have a new sensation, to see a little
more of the world again,' said Colville,
evasively, as he was not disposed to tell
his thoughtless listeners&mdash;some four or
five officers&mdash;assembled for tiffin (<i>i.e.</i>,
lunch) about his romance, and the
temporary loss of Mary Wellwood.
</p>

<p>
'A new sensation!' exclaimed Algy
Redhaven, a handsome young captain of the
10th Hussars, who had just entered the
bungalow; 'you are likely to have it soon
enough.  Have you heard the news that
has just come in from the front, colonel?'
he added to Spatterdash.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;what the devil is up?' growled
the old field-officer.
</p>

<p>
'Fresh complications are likely at
Cabul&mdash;the Ameer Shere Ali has gone to visit
the Russian general at Tashkend.'
</p>

<p>
'Whew!' whistled old Spatterdash;
'that will likely precipitate matters.  I
always thought the invasion of British
India by Russia would be as practicable a
few years hence as that of Italy by Austria,
and now, by Jove, we seem close upon it.'
</p>

<p>
And since the date we write of the
Russians have pushed on to Merv in
Turkomania!
</p>

<p>
The group of officers who were invited
to the colonel's table were all happy and
heedless young fellows belonging to Sir
Samuel Browne's column, and high in
anticipation of a protracted 'shindy' with
the Afghans, as a force was being
concentrated at Jellalabad.
</p>

<p>
A couple were on the staff, like Colville;
one&mdash;Redhaven&mdash;belonged to the Royal
Hussars; two others to a native infantry
regiment; all were somewhat airily attired,
and, till tiffin made its appearance, all
were smoking cheroots so industriously
that clouds of their pale smoke curled
among the rough rafters and straw roof
of the bungalow.
</p>

<p>
Jellalabad, where the fortune of war
had then cast them, the winter residence
of the Cabul monarchs since the consolidation
of the Dooranee Empire, is situated
in an extensive valley of considerable
beauty and fertility, eight-and-twenty miles
long by about four broad, and the town
had before this been rendered memorable
by the heroic stand which Sir Robert Sale,
with a handful of British soldiers, made
in it against the Afghans some forty years
before.
</p>

<p>
In importance it was originally only
next to Cabul and Candahar, but its
fortifications had been completely destroyed
by General Pollock after the war that
ended in 1842.  Like all Afghan cities of
note, it had its Balla Hissar, half palace
and half citadel, with a poor population
estimated at from three to ten thousand.
</p>

<p>
Many streams fertilise its valley&mdash;namely,
the Cabul River, which flows near the
walls; the Surkh Rud, or Red River, and
the Kara Su, or Black River, while around
it are numerous castles, and picturesque
villages, and groups of forest trees, though
an arid desert spreads in its immediate vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Nearly four months had elapsed since
Leslie Colville had parted from Mary
Wellwood, and already as many ages
seemed to have elapsed since the few brief
days of reunion they had spent together
at Grosvenor Square; and now he knew
that many more months must elapse, must
be faced and endured, ere he could hope to
turn his steps towards Europe; and even
while sitting there, among these bantering
and somewhat noisy fellows, he looked
around him as one in a dream, whose
thoughts were far away, while Mary's soft,
sad features came vividly before him in
memory and in their beauty, though the
latter, as some old poet says,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Is in no face, but in the lover's mind.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'How silent you are, Colville!' exclaimed
old Spatterdash, relinquishing the
mouthpiece of his hookah for a moment.  'Gad,
I believe the fellow's in love.'
</p>

<p>
So full were his thoughts of Mary at
that precise moment that he almost
coloured as if they had been read by the
colonel, who continued, in a tone of banter,
</p>

<p>
'With you, I suppose, it is,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "&mdash;&mdash;to bid me not to love<br />
  Is to forbid my pulse to move,<br />
  My beard to grow, my ears to prick up;<br />
  Or, when I'm in the mood, to hiccup."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Is it so?  Well, anyway, stick to the <i>brandy
pawnee</i> till tiffin comes.'
</p>

<p>
Again the old familiar sound of the
cantonment <i>ghurries</i>, or gong-bells, as they
were clanged for the change of sentries,
was in his ear, and the view from the open
windows of the bungalow was strange and
striking.
</p>

<p>
Far away above the misty horizon rose
amid the clouds&mdash;and cloudlike themselves,
so bright and varied were their tints&mdash;the
majestic mountains that tower between
the shallow valley of Jellalabad and the
ramparts of Cabul, and chief of them is
the stupendous Suffaidh Koh, fourteen
thousand feet in height, then covered with
dazzling white snow; and if wondrously
beautiful by day, it was perhaps still more
so by night, when the full moon lit up its
chasms and peaks with its Asiatic splendour.
</p>

<p>
In the immediate foreground, just before
the windows of the bungalow, a curious
scene&mdash;one illustrative of the distant
region and the manners of our Indian
fellow-subjects&mdash;was in progress.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Poojah</i> of a battalion of H.M. Native
Infantry, a Hindoo regiment, was being
celebrated towards evening.
</p>

<p>
The battalion, in full marching order,
with its colours, was drawn up in a circle.
At each cardinal point of the compass was
a small clod of earth, with barley and rice
on it; and in the centre were the attendant
Brahmins with a beautiful young goat,
which had been sprinkled with pure water,
barley, and rice.  Then the sacrificer drew
a huge Ghoorkali knife, and, after muttering
some prayers, by one trenchant slash
severed the head of the goat from its body.
At the moment of immolation twelve guns
boomed through the air and drums were
beaten, after which the battalion was
wheeled back into line, and marched by
fours into its lines, with band playing and
colours flying.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Spatterdash, Colville's host, was
a thorough Indian officer of the old school,
who had broiled for so many years in
Bengal that he had lost much of his
European identity, all memory of home nearly,
and religion too, and had become so
bronzed that evil-disposed fellows used to
hint&mdash;but not in his presence&mdash;that he had
'a dash of the tar-brush in him&mdash;was
fourteen annas to the rupee,' and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The wags of the station at Chutneypore
declared that he wore a gold bangle
given to him by the orange-visaged Rani
of that place, who liked him as 'a wicked
old man,' that squeezed her brown paws
when he assisted her into the silk-curtained
howdah of her great tusker elephant, which
had carried 'Colonel Wellesley's' baggage
at the battle of Assaye.
</p>

<p>
He was full of old Indian memories of
the Rangoon Rangers and Bhurtpore
Bulldogs, as he had heard of them when he
came out from Addiscombe a cadet and
griffin; and had many a story to tell of
the pre-railway times, when, if not
marching, people travelled by <i>dâk</i>, night and
day, in palanquins; when the old Bengal
colonel was a father to his regiment, the
guide of his subalterns, and was never so
happy as when he had a dozen or so at his
table, all eager for <i>Kowab</i>, fresh eggs, with
Phillibut rice, kedgere, &amp;c., and <i>Bhola</i> in
plenty.
</p>

<p>
He was a captain when the mutiny
occurred; and its horrors, with the dismay
that his beloved Sepoys&mdash;the <i>Spatterdash-ka-Pultan</i>,
so-called from his father&mdash;should
prove untrue to their salt, nearly broke his
heart; and he thought the end of the
world had come when they flung him down
a well at Gungawallah; but he was hard
to kill.  A banyan-tree that grew half way
down broke his fall, and to that he clung
till rescued by some Highlanders, after
which he solaced himself mightily by
blowing whole batches of 'pandies' from
his guns.
</p>

<p>
And now tiffin came, curried chickens,
rice, green chillis, mutton and chutney,
&amp;c., &amp;c., with plenty of wine and brandy,
all laid out by his faithful old Kitmutgar,
wearing an enormous white turban.
</p>

<p>
'Anything,' said the colonel, 'is better
than bitter beer that has been boiling on
the dusty road between Peshawur and
Jellalabad, till the cask hoops grow hot in
the sun.'
</p>

<p>
So he took a huge beaker of <i>brandy
pawnee</i>, as he reclined in the cane
easy-chair in his well tattied bungalow, with
punkah wallahs crouching in the verandah
outside, and smoked his hookah, for he
preferred such a residence to a double-poled
tent or a tumble-down brick house
in that city of earthquakes, till the troops
marched.
</p>

<p>
'I knew your uncle, Wellwood, thoroughly,'
said the colonel to Colville.  'He
and I were great chums, and I once saw
him do a plucky thing&mdash;a very plucky
thing, by Jove!&mdash;when we were giving a
fellow a tight flogging under fire.'
</p>

<p>
'A flogging under fire&mdash;that was
remarkable, surely?'
</p>

<p>
'Not so in those days; we were never
squeamish about anything then.'
</p>

<p>
'And this plucky thing?' said Redhaven,
the hussar.
</p>

<p>
'Convinced me that Wellwood was
pretty reckless of life.  He had been
soured by some disappointment in love,
we heard&mdash;the idea of such a thing!'
</p>

<p>
And, while old Splatterdash laughed a
little contemptuously at the thought of a
tender passion, Colville, remembering the
secret episode of Mrs. Deroubigne's life,
listened with some interest.
</p>

<p>
'It came about in this way, you see,'
said the colonel, after taking a long pull
at his hookah.  'After we advanced upon
Jhansi under Sir Hugh Rose to crush the
rebellious Sepoys who held the place
(which was a town and fortress of the
Mahrattas of old), we bombarded it
heavily for four days, but not without
resistance, for the shattered remains of the
Gwalior contingent, augmented to twenty-five
thousand bayonets and sabres, and
eighteen pieces of cannon from Kalpee,
came marching along the right bank of
the Jumna, hoping to raise the siege, d&mdash;n
them!
</p>

<p>
'In that, however, the Pandies were
disappointed.  During the bombardment,
when we were pitching shot and shell into
each other, a great thirteen-inch bomb
from an old mortar happened to fall close
by where the soldier of a European
regiment was tied up to "the halberts," as we
still called the triangles, to receive a
hundred and fifty lashes for insubordination
when mad with drink and heat.  The
sudden appearance of this great missile,
with its fuse burning and hissing, caused
such confusion and consternation that the
companies, formed in hollow square, fell
back on all sides, even breaking their
ranks, for none could composedly await
such an explosion under their noses.
</p>

<p>
'Instead of yielding to this natural
impulse, Wellwood took from his pocket a
penknife, and, walking up to the helpless
and terrified creature who was bound to
the triangles, he cut the cords that bound
his wrists and ankles, setting him free,
and both had barely time to retire a little
way and throw themselves flat on the
ground, when the great shell burst, and
a hurricane of iron swept over them and
all around.  Thus did he save this poor
fellow, who must inevitably have perished
from his inability to save himself; and
Wellwood did more, for, in consideration
of the mental agony the man had undergone,
he remitted the remainder of the
punishment; and, by a curious coincidence,
the culprit perished a few days after in
the action of Roohea when saving the life
of Wellwood, whom some rebels were about
to bayonet as he lay wounded and helpless
on the ground.'
</p>

<p>
'This will be an episode in her father's
life to tell Mary of when next I write to
her,' thought Colville.  And now the
conversation drifted into the subject then
uppermost in the minds of all&mdash;the probability
of serious complications if Russian
intrigues proved successful at Cabul, and
none could expect them to be otherwise
when the Ameer Shere Ali had departed
openly to visit General Kauffmann at
Tashkend, in Central Asia, which place,
however, he was fated not to reach.
</p>

<p>
The subject that caused our dispute
with him, and brought our troops to
Jellalabad and elsewhere upon his frontier,
was the dispute known then as the "Resident"
question, because he rather favoured
the Russians, and thus refused to have
any such British official at his court for
three reasons&mdash;firstly, the person of a
Briton would not be safe there; secondly,
that European officers might make
demands that would occasion quarrels; and
thirdly, that if Britain was represented,
Russia would expect to be represented
also.  But it was known that he was in
close correspondence with General
Kauffman, and only feared that a British
Resident might, if present, throw some light
upon it; and in the end a convention was
signed, by which Russia bound herself to
give at least moral support to the existing
Afghan dynasty.
</p>

<p>
An envoy sent by our government to
Cabul never reached it, being forced back
at a place called Ali Musjid.  For this an
apology was demanded, and Afghanistan
was entered by a British army in three
columns that won several victories, and
the Ameer finding his case hopeless started
for Tashkend, but died on the way, and
was succeeded by his son, Yakoub Khan,
who eventually showed a disposition to
come to terms with us; but in this we are
a little anticipating the events of our
story, for, at the time Leslie Colville joined
the staff at Jellalabad, Sir Samuel Browne
was, as stated, collecting a force there,
while General Maude relieved his post
between that place and Dakka, and the
gallant Roberts, posted further forward at the
Peiwar Pass, was improving the difficult
mountain road between that place and
Cabul for the passage of guns and baggage.
</p>

<p>
So thus it was that our troops were now
engaged in what was known as the second
Afghan War&mdash;to counteract Russian influences.
</p>

<p>
As the evening advanced and darkness
closed in, some yells and oaths in Hindostanee
and Pushtoo were heard at a little
distance outside the hedge of the colonel's
compound, and Colville, who had been
looking from a window, now started to his feet.
</p>

<p>
'I can't look on and permit that!' he
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Can't permit what?' asked Spatterdash, tartly.
</p>

<p>
'A lot of fellows&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Budmashes, no doubt, by the row they make.'
</p>

<p>
'Ill-using one man; and now, as it is
time for me to go, colonel, I shall interfere
<i>en passant</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't think of it&mdash;don't bother!'
</p>

<p>
'But they may kill him.'
</p>

<p>
'What the devil does it matter?  A
nigger less in the world won't be missed,'
growled Spatterdash, who had lost all
sympathy with the natives since the Mutiny.
</p>

<p>
'Call the nearest guard&mdash;the picket&mdash;or
some chowkeydars,' said Redhaven and
others; 'but don't interfere in a row of
this kind.'
</p>

<p>
Colville, however, buckled on his sword
and revolver, lit a fresh cheroot, laughingly
bowed himself out, and hurried away; for,
sooth to say, he was a little tired of old
Spatterdash, and as no one actually
thought he would interfere in a native row,
no one followed or accompanied him.
</p>

<p>
'The inlying pickets have been doubled
to-night by order of the general,' said the
colonel.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked some one.
</p>

<p>
'Because rumour says that the Sirdir
Mahmoud Shah, a tearing Afghan devil,
has come to lead the Mohmunds against us.'
</p>

<p>
'With what object?' asked Redhaven of
the Hussars.
</p>

<p>
'A row, of course.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE HADJI.
</h3>

<p>
'The world is a small place, after all!'
thought Colville, as he left the Colonel's
bungalow behind him.  'Think of hearing
here that anecdote of dear Mary's father
from that old subadar!  Well, well, "life,"
as some one says, "is a perpetual enigma,
to which no theological system offers a
satisfactory solution&mdash;against the reefs of
which all philosophies break into foam and
empty bubbles."  But here are more than
bubbles, by Jove!  Now what is all this
deuced row about?' he added, drawing
his sword, on seeing before him the authors
of the noise he had heard, engaged still in
a wild and fierce <i>mêlée</i>.
</p>

<p>
This was in a sequestered part of the
town, and near some of the ruins of houses
shaken down by the earthquakes some
forty years ago.  One man was contending
single-handed against no less than
five, and in the clear starlight Colville
could see the flash of their gleaming eyes,
their set teeth, their dark and infuriated
faces.  The man assaulted wore an Afghan
costume, a cloak, a kind of blouse with
loose sleeves, and on his head a <i>loonjee</i>.
The others had flowing garments and large
turbans, and were armed with heavily-loaded
clubs, against which the stranger
was defending himself with no small
dexterity with only a pilgrim's staff; for, by
his wallet, gourd, and beads, he was
evidently a hadji, who had become involved
in a quarrel with some Wahabis, who, it
seemed afterwards, had been mocking him
for praying at the tomb of a Santon, and
told him he should call on God, and on no
imaginary saint, on which, he had proceeded
at once to lay about him with his
pilgrim's staff.
</p>

<p>
'To call a man a Wahabi,' says Sterndale,
'is, to nine-tenths of Englishmen in
India, to call him a fanatic, a rebel, a sort
of Mahometan fenian, one whom the police
should take under special surveillance, and
whose every action is open to suspicion.'
</p>

<p>
Like the English Puritans, they&mdash;in
addition to deriding the intercession of
saints&mdash;despoiled the mosques of their
lamps and decorations, broke down all
shrines, prohibited music and dancing, and
smoking was denounced as a mortal sin;
and now those whom Colville found
himself opposed to would undoubtedly&mdash;but
for his sword and revolver&mdash;have made
short work of it with the unfortunate
hadji.
</p>

<p>
He drove them back a few paces, and
the hadji, while panting for breath, and
streaming with blood from more than one
contused wound, continued to revile them
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'Wahabis&mdash;accursed Wahabis!' he
exclaimed, 'dare they speak to me?  I am
a Soonee, not a dog!  I am not a Shiah,
the follower of Ali, but an orthodox
Soonee, like my forefathers, blessed be
God and His Prophet!  Wretches,' he
added, with all the ferocious rancour of
religion and race, 'your souls will yet
defile hell!'
</p>

<p>
'Begone, and leave the man to go on
his way,' said Colville, authoritatively, as
he waved his sword, for he knew enough
of Arabic and Hindostanee to understand
what was said and the nature of the
brawl.
</p>

<p>
'Dogs!' resumed the irate hadji,
encouraged by his presence and succour;
'know ye not that the time is coming
when the Wahabis shall be judged according
to their deserts, and each in passing a
dead man's grave shall say, "Would to
God that I lay there!"'
</p>

<p>
'Dog of a Soonee, when will that time
come to pass?' asked one, jeeringly.
</p>

<p>
'When the sun rises in the west,'
shrieked the hadji, frantic with rage;
'when the beast shall rise out of the earth
near Mecca; when a smoke shall cover the
earth, and the Mahdi shall come to everyone
and fill the earth with righteousness.'
</p>

<p>
And much more to this effect did he
vow with singular force and fluency, for
the hadji was an Afghan, and, so far as
regards the external forms of their
religion, the Afghans are wonderfully devout,
and so much of their conversation, whatever
the subject, is so tinged with their
religion and the Koran that one would
imagine the whole people, from the Ameer
to the humblest camel-driver, were
engaged in holy reflections, and scarcely is
a sentence uttered by them without some
reference to the Deity.
</p>

<p>
One of the Wahabis now seemed to lose
what little remains of sense or temper he
had left, and, uttering a savage yell, swung
aloft his ponderous <i>lohbunda</i> or staff, which
was heavily shod with iron&mdash;a weapon one
well-directed stroke from which would
have spattered the brains of the hadji on
the street&mdash;but Colville, quick as lightning,
warded off the blow with his sword,
in the process of which his right arm
tingled to the shoulder; and as at that
moment the tramp of a patrol from an
inlying picquet was heard approaching,
the brawlers took to flight, and Colville
was left face to face with the man whose
life he had saved.
</p>

<p>
'Sahib, I have to thank you gratefully
for this prompt and courageous succour,
but for which these dogs would no doubt
have slain me,' said the pilgrim in English;
'as it is, they have handled me so roughly
that I am barely able to stand.'
</p>

<p>
'You speak English very fluently,' said
Colville, with genuine surprise.  'How is
this?'
</p>

<p>
'My uncle was a <i>muhafez dufter</i>, or
keeper of the records, in the office of the
district magistrate, near Peshawur, who
educated me to work in his office; but at
his death I went back to the hills and
became an Afghan soldier under Shere Ali.'
</p>

<p>
'And now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I am a poor harmless hadji, Mahommed
Shah, seeking but to save his soul,' said
he, lowering his keen and glittering eyes,
as he looked steadily around him.  'In
saving me you have done a good action,
and what says the fourth chapter of the
Koran?  "Verily, God will not wrong
anyone, even the weight of an ant, and, if
it be a good action, He will double it, and
recompense it in His sight with a great
and just reward."  But these thrice
accursed Wahabis,' he added, grinding his
teeth with rage, and making thereby a
very unpleasant sound, 'may be swallowed
up by the earth as the accuser of Moses
was.'
</p>

<p>
Colville looked around him warily.  In
the dark, unlighted, and tortuous streets
of the city this poor man might easily be
overtaken and murdered by these fanatics,
if they were&mdash;as Colville did not doubt&mdash;still
lurking watchfully about, so he said,
</p>

<p>
'Come with me to the Balla Hissar; I
am quartered there, and can keep you in
safety for the night; besides, your wounds
must be dressed, and in the morning I
would advise your instantly quitting Jellalabad.'
</p>

<p>
'As-taffur-ullah! that will I, sahib; and
by the five keys of knowledge, I will never
forget your kindness.'
</p>

<p>
The citadel was close by.  There
Colville took his new acquaintance past the
sentries to the rooms assigned as his
quarters, quaint and lofty apartments with
marble floors, and walls covered with
beautiful arabesques, splendid but
comfortless, and, summoning the soldier who
acted as his servant, with lights, some
wine and bandages, he desired him to
bathe and bind up the wounds of the old
Afghan wanderer, who was on the point
of sinking, and would have done so, but
for some water which he took, dashed with
brandy, despite the precepts of the Koran.
</p>

<p>
'You have had a narrow escape!' said
Colville, looking at some of his bruises.
</p>

<p>
'It is perhaps useless to bind these wounds.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because if a man is to die he will die.'
</p>

<p>
'But if a man is ailing surely he may be cured?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied the hadji, 'through the Koran.'
</p>

<p>
'Koran again!' thought Colville.  'You
mean by faith in it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; by writing therefrom some holy
sentences on paper, and drinking the water
wherein that paper has been washed clean.'
</p>

<p>
'You have heard, I suppose, that the
Ameer has gone over to the Russians?'
said Colville to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sahib,' replied the hadji, in whose
eyes a strange light now appeared, 'but
he is dying of mortal disease, and will
never reach Tashkend.'
</p>

<p>
'Then Yakoub Khan will succeed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; the man who has already aspired
to sit on a <i>musnud</i> (throne) is little likely
to content himself with a carpet, especially
if supported by the bayonets of the <i>Ghora
logue</i>.  By the Prophet, no!' added the
hadji, referring to what was well known&mdash;that
Yakoub Khan had conspired against
his father, who, in consequence, had kept
him for years imprisoned in a dungeon
without light.
</p>

<p>
The hadji seemed a genuine Afghan,
and considerably past middle-age.  He
was tall, spare, and muscular, with
aquiline&mdash;almost Jewish&mdash;features; high cheek
bones, and strong, black, glittering eyes,
with an intensity and keenness in their
expression that reminded Colville of those
of a mountain eagle.  He was fairer
complexioned than most of his people, among
whom even red hair is sometimes met with;
but his face had been cleft from temple to
chin by a tulwar stroke in some past battle
or brawl; and now the livid mark of that
terrible slash could be seen distinctly as
altering, and in some measure distorting,
features that were naturally very regular.
</p>

<p>
After partaking of a little food of the
plainest kind, he performed the ablutions
enjoined by his faith, spread a white cloth
over his kneeling-carpet, and, turning his
face in the direction of Mecca, said his
<i>salat al Moghreb</i>, or evening prayer, while
Colville took himself off to the mess-room;
and when he returned the hadji was lying
on the verandah outside, fast asleep, and
cosily muffled up in his dark-coloured choga,
or camel-hair cloak.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he had left the Bala
Hissar, and gone, none knew where, save
that he had been seen going towards Cabul
by the way of the Ali Musjid Pass.
</p>

<p>
It never occurred to Leslie Colville, in
performing the acts of kindness he had
done to this stranger, whether there might
be peril or evil evolved from them in the
future; or whether the man was&mdash;as he
ultimately proved to be&mdash;a keen and
observant spy, come to watch and note the
strength, preparations, and object of Sir
Samuel Browne's column; and, poor
though the hadji looked, Colville's
servant&mdash;a more than usually sharp example of
Private Thomas Atkins&mdash;had found him
in the early morning reckoning over a
quantity of gold in his wallet, and one of
these which he dropped was found to be of
the last Russian mintage.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
A FIGHT WITH THE MOHMUNDS.
</h3>

<p>
Save for flying rumours cantonment life at
Jellalabad had been a little monotonous
for some time past.  Paper hunts had been
resorted to, and polo was played every
afternoon by officers of the 10th Hussars,
riding Cabul ponies upon a piece of ground
cleared for them by their men about two
miles from the city.
</p>

<p>
Other officers exercised their skill in
'potting,' with the breechloader, quails,
and the beautiful partridge, called the
'hill chuckore' by the Afghans, wild
sheep, and antelopes, while some of the
more adventurous brought down a wolf
or hyena, but as these were chiefly to be
found at a distance some personal risk
was incurred, and one might be 'potted'
in turn by the 'juzail' of some hill-man
lurking unseen behind a rock or tree.
</p>

<p>
The counterbalance to these little
amusements were visitations of wind and dust,
or torrents of rain, that pattered like a
storm of dry peas on the tents of the
troops who were in camp near the city, so,
when the weather had become settled, all
hailed with considerable satisfaction the
advent of the expedition under General
Macpherson to look after a gathering of
the Mohmunds&mdash;a tribe of about fifty
thousand souls, whose fighting men were
reported as mustering for mischief on the
other side of the Cabul river, in the
south-west corner of the Jellalabad Valley,
opposite to Girdi Kas, where the stream flows
away towards Chardeh.
</p>

<p>
The staff were in their saddles betimes,
and on the ground in front of the city.
</p>

<p>
'Good morning, gentlemen,' said old
Spatterdash, as he came cantering up on
his Arab in the dark.  'What is the hour?'
</p>

<p>
Colville adroitly caught a firefly, and
placing it for a moment on the glass of his
watch, saw the time.
</p>

<p>
'Four o'clock, colonel.'
</p>

<p>
'We have other work this morning than
pig-sticking or potting jackals and foxes;
but there is time yet for a cup of coffee
dashed with brandy&mdash;a cheroot, and then
away.'
</p>

<p>
'The bugles are sounding, and there go
the trumpets of the Hussars and Lancers
blowing "boot and saddle."'
</p>

<p>
Disdaining the use of a regulation
sword, which he stigmatised as an 'army
tailor's blunt knife,' Colonel Spatterdash
rode with an enormous tulwar by his
side&mdash;a weapon once wielded by the great
rebel Tantia Topee&mdash;one literally for
slicing, and having such an edge that
he might have shaved with it.  He was
in high spirits, and being still practically
under the influence of his potations
overnight, was humming the song of 'The
Sepoy Grenadiers'&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The spirits of our sires,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gathered such renown<br />
  From clouds of battle fires,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stern delight look down,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To Delhi and to Deeg they point,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those stars of other years;<br />
  And bid us still uphold the fame<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of <i>the Sepoy Grenadiers</i>!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'I'm not likely to die from "waste of
nervous tissue," as the doctors call it,
whatever the devil it may be,' he added,
as he unsheathed his tulwar, that flashed
in the paling starlight; 'we'll have a
burra khana' (<i>i.e.</i>, big dinner) 'when we
come back, after polishing off these
Mohmund fellows.'
</p>

<p>
'At least all who are able to partake
of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be gloomy, Colville; d&mdash;n it, I
never am.'
</p>

<p>
The force for this expedition was made
up of detachments from the column; there
were some of the Rifles, with some of the
Ghoorkas, 1st Sikhs, and 20th Punjaub
Infantry, one hundred of the 10th Hussars
under Captain St. Quintin, and one
hundred of the 11th Bengal Lancers, in blue
uniforms faced with red, under Major
Princep.  De Latour's Hazara Mountain
Battery came clattering up, and two Royal
Horse Artillery guns, which latter, with a
small force, proceeded at once on
observation down the right bank of the Cabul
river, in case any of the Mohmunds might
have taken post in that direction.
</p>

<p>
At half-past four in the morning the
whole force&mdash;not much over a thousand
men&mdash;after forming in silence and as
quickly as possible, without further sound
of drum or bugle, moved off, and, with
St. Quintin's hussars in the van, crossed the
river by the new bridge erected by our
Royal Engineers, and advanced into the
dark country beyond, where the only
sounds heard were the wails of an occasional
jackal, replied to by those of a pack
of his fourfooted brethren.
</p>

<p>
In galloping from point to point, when
the troops were forming under arms and
then in columns of march, giving the
general's last orders or directions, Colville
had not much time for abstract reflection,
yet a certain idea did occur to him, and he
muttered, with a glow of the purest satisfaction,
</p>

<p>
'If I fall to-day or any other day, thank
God I have made all square for my dear
girl and her sister, too.'
</p>

<p>
This referred to a secret visit paid by
him to Lincoln's Inn 'anent' codicils to
his will the day before he left London;
and now he recalled with astonishment the
time when he either disliked these
unknown cousins or forgot that they existed.
</p>

<p>
Though Mohammed, Khan of Lalpura
and chief of the Mohmunds, had made
complete submission apparently to Sir
Louis Cavagnari at Dakka, in the preceding
year, it did not prevent his people
from opposing us now in arms, like many
other mountain tribes.
</p>

<p>
After the hoofs of the cavalry and wheels
of the artillery had made the planks of the
trestle-bridge resound, silence again fell
on the column; and when the moon came
out in its oriental splendour, amid some
weird, windy, and fast-flying clouds, there
was light enough to see the column
distinctly.
</p>

<p>
The sheeny bayonets of the infantry and
the spearheads of the lancers (denuded
<i>pro temp.</i> of their fluttering banneroles)
glittered brightly, as did the sword-blades
of all the officers; and our cavalry are
generally so gaily appointed that, when
the 10th Hussars went cantering to the
front, the flashes of light reflected from
their accoutrements, if they added to the
picturesque, also added to the peril of the
occasion, if any scouting Mohmunds were
about, as this alone would have revealed
the advance of the force, which from its
sombre costume would have been, otherwise,
almost invisible&mdash;but the tropical
white helmets were always prominent
objects amid the gloom.
</p>

<p>
At this time, all our troops in Afghanistan
wore Cashmere putties, or leg-bandages,
made of strips of woollen cloth, two
yards and a half long, with a tape stitched
on at the end. They were worn round
the calf of the leg from the ankle to
the knee, where the tape secured them.
For cavalry and infantry alike they were
a useful and warm addition to the clothing
in cold weather; and there was but one
objection&mdash;the time necessary for binding
them on.
</p>

<p>
Some natives acted as guides, and in the
cold moonlight the cavalry and artillery
went clattering over rough stones, and
more than one of the former fell from his
horse, and of the latter off the limber-seats,
as some sudden and deceitful ditch
or water channel had to be crossed. The
enemy was in front; no one knew precisely
when or where he might be fallen on, and
this added to the zest and excitement of
the time and occasion.
</p>

<p>
The orders of the cavalry were to spur
on in front; to get in between the
Mohmunds and the hills, for the purpose of
cutting off their retreat; and a picturesque
sight were the Hussars and Lancers, as
they dashed through the Kunar River
(which joins the Cabul about five miles from
Jellalabad), in its descent from Shigar,
and flashes of light came from their
glancing accoutrements as they vanished away
from the sight of the infantry in the gloom
ahead, when a cloud passed over the face
of the moon.
</p>

<p>
Next came the infantry splashing through
the Kunar, which rose to the men's
waist-belts, and was broad at the point where
it was crossed; and a bath such as it
gave was not a desirable beginning in a
cold morning with the work they had in
hand.
</p>

<p>
At one place the route lay over what
seemed to have been an old Mohammedan
burial-ground. Coffins are not used in
the East, the body being simply rolled
up in a sheet, and placed in the grave
with only a foot or two of earth spread
over it. Into these receptacles the wheels
of the guns stuck fast in succession,
compelling the gunners to quit the
limber-seats and drag them out, crushing and
grinding the human bones beneath, and
causing an expression of much rough
language unfitted for ears polite. If the
superstition of the Afghans, who greatly
venerate burial places, which they call
'Cities of the Silent,' be true, that the
ghosts of the dead sit at the head of their
own graves, invisible to mortal eyes,
enjoying the odours of the flowers planted
there, the said ghosts must have been
somewhat scared by the row Her Majesty's
gunners made till they got their
seven-pounders free from this succession of
traps, and once more on solid ground;
and also by old Spatterdash, who was
impatient to get his Sepoys forward, and
swore in English and Hindostanee.
</p>

<p>
Though the Kunar river, which takes
its rise near the great Pamir Steppe and
Bam-i-Duniah, or 'the Roof of the World,'
was left in the rear, the troops had to
splash through several tributaries of it ere
they obtained higher ground, and then
they began to look upon scenery wild and
mighty, rugged and uncultured, where
wolves peopled the forest, the elk and deer
haunted the brook, and the crane and the
stork hovered about the watercourses, and
over all, desolate and savage, towered the
mountains of Shigar, many thousands of
feet in height.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the route lay between groves
of dark poplars, of pale green willows, or
dwarf palm, sunk amid which the tributaries
of the Kunar flowed like streaks of
silver; and sometimes between vegetation
familiar to the British eye&mdash;the ash, the
oak, the chestnut, and hawthorn, though
mingling with the cedar, the olive, and
fig.
</p>

<p>
Major Louis Cavaguari, a handsome
dark-complexioned man, whom Colville
now saw for the first time, came riding
up and joined the staff, accompanied by a
brilliantly attired and accoutred Afghan
horseman, whom he introduced as the
Khan of Besoot, from whom much useful
information could be gathered, among
others that a range of hills in front was
full of the enemy under a fanatic named
Moollah Khalil.
</p>

<p>
The Ghoorkas, who were leading, were
now ordered to seek cover as soon as they
had left in rear a village near these hills,
while the cavalry swung round to take
these in flank or cut off the retreat of the
enemy, and with that force went Colville
with a message from the general.
</p>

<p>
While galloping on to overtake them he
could see the files who were to skirmish
dart out in extended order with unslung
carbines, and soon the cracking of
exchanged shots quickened every pulse as
they were heard among the hills.
</p>

<p>
'Push forward the mountain battery!'
was now the general's order.
</p>

<p>
It was galloped to the south side of a
projecting ridge, while old Spatterdash,
with some of the Punjaub infantry, began
to scale its rocky crest. There the
Mohmunds were in position, but so dingily
were they attired, or so much did the
colour of their costume blend with that of
the rocks and trees, that, though not a
single man of them could as yet be separately
distinguished, the existence of their
masses was known by the flashing of their
arms in the sunshine, or by the fluttering
out of a red or green village banner against
the sky-line.
</p>

<p>
While measures were thus being taken
to have them on the flank and an attack
was delivered in front, De Latour got his
mountain guns ready for action, and sent
a shell at a thousand yards' range whistling
through the air. Curving in its course, it
fell and burst among them high up on the
ridge, scattering death and mutilation.
Another and another fell, and then, as the
arms ceased to glitter, it was known that
the Mohmunds were falling back.
</p>

<p>
Again the flashing of their weapons in
the sunshine, and the jets of white smoke
from their long juzails, levelled over bank
and rock, but fired at long and almost
useless distances, announced a rally or
pause in their retreat, the line of which
lay along a plain that extended away to
the eastward, and onward through that
space and clouds of rising dust swept the
cavalry, followed by the infantry at the
double.
</p>

<p>
The skirmishers of Redhaven's troop
having, in the ardour of pursuit, advanced
too far into a dell, became suddenly
exposed to a galling fire, which emptied
more than one saddle; and Colville dashed
forward with orders for their recall.
</p>

<p>
The trumpet sounded the 'retire,' and
it was obeyed by all but one hussar,
who continued to load and fire, while
the juzail balls whistled about him, and
knocked up jets of sand about his horse's
hoofs.
</p>

<p>
'Sound again!' said Lieutenant Redhaven
to the trumpeter, who sat with the
bell of the trumpet planted on his thigh.
</p>

<p>
Again he blew, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
'He is too far&mdash;he does not hear it&mdash;the
fellow will be lost!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he hears it well enough, sir,' replied
the trumpeter; 'but just now he pretends
to be deaf.'
</p>

<p>
'Deaf!&mdash;what the devil does he mean?
To throw his life away?'
</p>

<p>
'Looks like it, from what I have seen of
him more than once.'
</p>

<p>
'He is a brave but reckless fool!'
exclaimed Redhaven, impetuously, as he was
now seen engaged with four Afghan horsemen,
after having slung his carbine, and
drawn his sword; and by this time Colville,
full of pity and admiration, inspired
also by the passing remarks of the
trumpeter, was already on the spur to succour
him.
</p>

<p>
'Allow me, sir, that officer can't go
alone; besides, the poor fellow is my own
comrade,' said a hussar, who, without
waiting for Redhaven's consent, dashed the
spurs into his horse, settled himself well
down on the saddle, and in less than a
minute was among the cloud of dust,
where Colville and the other hussar were
in close <i>mêlée</i> with the four Afghans, one
of whom was the Moollah Khalil, who was
armed, not with a tulwar, but an enormous
maul, furnished with a round knob of gilt
metal.
</p>

<p>
'Allah Ackbar, Mohammed resool illa,'
he was shrieking, with blazing eyes, as he
goaded his horse in the fray, and laid about
him like a madman, and by one blow
brained or stunned the horse of the
skirmisher whose rashness had brought this
combat about, and during which the juzailchees
had ceased firing, lest they might hit
their own leader.
</p>

<p>
Ere the hussar could free himself from
his stirrups the maul was about to descend
on his head, when a thrust from Colville's
sword, delivered under the right arm,
pierced the lungs of Moollah Khalil, who
fell to rise no more, and, protecting the
hussar by a great circular sweep of his
sword, Colville dragged him up by his
bridle hand, and mounted him on the
Moollah's horse.  His follower had now
disposed of a second Afghan just as his
horse was shot under him, and the two
others, terrified by the fall of the Moollah,
fled at a gallop, on which the <i>juzailchees</i>
resumed firing, and the shot whistled and
whirred past Colville and his companions.
</p>

<p>
'Quick&mdash;run as best you can,' said he,
putting his horse to a trot, but loth to
leave the two soldiers behind.
</p>

<p>
A wailing cry escaped one as a shot
evidently struck him, and Colville paused
by checking his bridle.  The man was
mortally wounded and ghastly pale, yet he
walked on for some thirty paces, erect and
steadily, his eyes fixed on vacancy; then
he paused, and fell dead on his face.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Sam Surcingle!' exclaimed the
other, and at that moment Colville also
dropped from his saddle, struck by a ball
in the left ribs.
</p>

<p>
Luckily it was a spent one, and only
knocked the breath out of him; but not a
moment was to be lost, as a few of the
Mohmund <i>juzailchees</i> were creeping back,
filled with the maddest rage at the death
of their fanatic leader, who had believed
his life to be charmed.
</p>

<p>
The hussar dragged Colville up, and
almost lifted him into the saddle, and
taking the bridle applied one spur to both
horses, and brought the officer into the
lines faint, worn, and with his mouth full
of blood.
</p>

<p>
When safe out of fire Colville dismounted
near a pool covered with crimson
water-lilies&mdash;the sacred lotus of Brahma&mdash;and
then the hussar whose life he had saved,
and who had succoured him in return,
opened his blue patrol jacket and proceeded,
after bathing his face and giving him a
draught from the pool, to examine his hurts
with a skilful hand.
</p>

<p>
'Not a rib broken, sir, thank God' said
he; 'only a contusion, and the consequent
discolouration will pass away in a few
days.  I haven't forgotten my Quain and
Turner.'
</p>

<p>
'Robert Wodrow!' exclaimed Colville,
recognising for the first time the
ex-medical student.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Captain Colville&mdash;Robert Wodrow
it is,' replied the other, with a sad
smile, as he proffered his brandy-flask.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;I have my own,' said Colville,
struggling into a sitting position.  'Mary
and Ellinor Wellwood told me of the step
you had taken&mdash;a very rash one I think
it&mdash;when you failed in your studies through
the mischief wrought you by that scoundrel
Sleath.'
</p>

<p>
'So you met them?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and left them well and every way,
I hope, happy.'
</p>

<p>
'It is an unexpected pleasure to see you
here, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'My poor fellow, if I can befriend you,
I shall, believe me,' said Colville, shaking
Robert's hand.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, Captain Colville; my officers
and comrades like me already, thank God;
and I am now a corporal.'
</p>

<p>
'They are right who assert that there is
nothing certain but the unexpected,' said
Colville, laughing, yet wincing the while
with pain; 'and this meeting with you has
been most unexpected by me.'
</p>

<p>
'But not by me, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'How so?'
</p>

<p>
'I have seen you in and about Jellalabad
for days and weeks past.'
</p>

<p>
'And why did you not speak to me?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not now what I was&mdash;when hoping
to be a graduate of the Edinburgh
University, but a poor hussar&mdash;<i>un simple
soldat</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Simple, indeed, to throw your chances
in life away thus&mdash;and even your life too,
as you so nearly did a few minutes ago.'
</p>

<p>
'I had none left&mdash;none that I cared for,'
said Robert, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
While this conversation was taking
place, the infantry and artillery had
halted, and the brigadier, with all the
cavalry, had pushed on in pursuit of
the fugitive Mohmunds as far as a place
called Gurdao, in a gorge, where the
Cabul river flows out of the valley of
Jellalabad.
</p>

<p>
On an islet in the river there are the
remains of an old Buddhist monastery,
surrounded by a tope of hoary trees.  For
here had once been the worship of
Buddha&mdash;a worship which, though now almost
banished from India, has spread over
countries of an almost wider area, and is
usually ranked as the ninth avatar of
Vishnu.
</p>

<p>
Here a few of the Mohmunds made their
last stand, till the best cavalry marksmen
picked them off with their carbines, and
the whole troops began a retrograde
movement towards Jellalabad.
</p>

<p>
Colville was once more in his saddle,
and, by Redhaven's permission, Robert
Wodrow attended to him on the march.
</p>

<p>
'I wish I understood the law of crises,'
says the author of <i>Altiora Peto</i>.  'I
suppose it has an intimate connection with
that other mysterious problem, the law of
chances ... I have always had a theory,'
he adds, 'that from time to time our lives
culminate to crises.  Then the crisis bursts,
and we begin again, and slowly or rapidly,
as the case may be, culminate to another
crisis.'
</p>

<p>
Well, here was a crisis and something
more in connection with the law of chances.
The two men who loved the two sisters,
Mary and Ellinor Wellwood, under
circumstances and with success so different,
by the birks of Invermay, were now face
to face and together in that far-away land
of peril.
</p>

<p>
After hearing Colville's little narrative
of what had transpired before he left
London, Robert Wodrow looked at him for a
time in silence, and thought how different
were their fates and probable future in the
world.
</p>

<p>
Colville had hope and wealth, he (Wodrow)
neither, and life seemed so valueless;
yet a couple of Afghan bullets might solve
all difficulties for both of them!
</p>

<p>
While the artillery made a detour to
avoid the pitfalls of the Mohammedan
burial-place, Wodrow was remarking to
the officer by whose side he rode,
</p>

<p>
'It would seem, Captain Colville, that,
as some writer says of the romance of life,
ours seems to be overtaking us pretty
quickly.'
</p>

<p>
'Romance, do you call it?'
</p>

<p>
'Bitterness, in my case, would be nearer
the truth.  I am a broken and ruined
man,' said the other, after a pause.
'Ellinor took the last ray of sunshine out of
my life.  She told me plainly that she
could not marry a poor man for the world,
nor wait till he became rich&mdash;a knowledge
that only came to her after Sir Redmond
Sleath found his way to Birkwoodbrae.
She was wiser, perhaps, but her wisdom,
poor girl, brought her nothing&mdash;nothing!
My love was only an ideal after all,
Captain Colville; and though life does not
seem to me worth living, it must be
lived&mdash;till ended&mdash;after all.'
</p>

<p>
Colville made no reply, but proffered his
cigar-case to the speaker, who accepted a
cigar with a courteous bow and blush of
pleasure; the very act was a kindly recognition
that they had once been equals, and
were still friends.
</p>

<p>
'You must quit this sort of thing,
Wodrow, and go back to your studies at
Edinburgh,' said Colville; 'back to Quain and
Turner, to Balfour's Botany, Jackson's
Materia Medica, and all the rest of it.  If
you want money for that or anything else,
consider me your banker.'
</p>

<p>
But Robert Wodrow shook his head with
an air of decision.  'Sir, I thank you from
my heart's core, but no, Captain Colville&mdash;never
again.'
</p>

<p>
'Tuts; we'll talk about all this another
time,' said Colville, kindly, hoping to bring
him to a right way of thinking and acting.
</p>

<p>
Yet while he declined all proffers of
assistance, Robert Wodrow's mind was full
of thoughts&mdash;soft, subduing, and kindly
thoughts&mdash;of his reverend father, his
mother so sweet and meek, so abiding and
confiding in the will and goodness of God,
and the old sequestered manse embowered
among the bonnie birks of Invermay&mdash;the
manse of Kirktoun-Mailler.
</p>

<p>
By midnight the returned expedition
marched into the lines of the camp at
Jellalabad.
</p>

<p>
'You have acted bravely to-day, Captain
Colville,' said the brigadier, shaking his
hand as the troops were dismissed to their
tents; 'and so sure as the stars look down
on us you shall have your V.C. for saving
the rash hussar and killing the Moollah
Khalil.  I wish you had polished off
Mohammed Shah, too, while you were about it.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is he?' asked Colville, to whom
the name seemed somehow familiar.
</p>

<p>
'One of the sirdars of the Ameer, and
a very distinguished one, now with the
Mohmunds.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove! that was the fellow who pretended
to be a hadji, and whom I had for
a night in the Bala Hissar&mdash;in the citadel
actually.'
</p>

<p>
'A lesson for you to be more careful
and less hospitable in future,' said the
brigadier, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Colville was duly complimented in
general orders, and weeks after the
latter was read and duly appreciated by
one who then was&mdash;far, far away!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
IN THE LUGHMAN VALLEY.
</h3>

<p>
The death of the Ameer, and succession
of his son, Yakoub Khan, were now
confirmed beyond all doubt at Jellalabad;
but troubles and skirmishes seemed to be
on the increase, and no man's life was safe.
</p>

<p>
In the country of the Shinwarris, a
district on the Afghan frontier, a
surveying party was attacked near Maidonak,
though escorted by old Spatterdash and
his Punjaub Infantry.  To the natives it
seemed that knocking little pegs into the
ground, sticking up little flags, and taking
the altitude of heights by a theodolite
could only be the blackest sorcery.  Other
instruments which were looked through
in a mysterious manner, with the notes
made on paper, were all deemed damnable
charms, and indications of talismanic power,
and the sirdar named Mahmoud Shah, who
was roving in that quarter, together with
Abdullah Mir, another adherent of Yakoub
Khan, reminded the people&mdash;as all Muslims
believe firmly in magic&mdash;of the evil
wrought by the wicked genie Sacar, the
inveterate foe of Solomon, of Eblis or
Degial, who, according to the Koran, was
that enemy of the human race who
accomplished the downfall of Adam, and much
more nonsense to the same purpose; so
the surveying party were furiously
attacked by a band of fanatics, armed with
tulwar, dagger, and juzail, in a solitary
place near the base of the Suffaidh Koh.
</p>

<p>
In the conflict that ensued a non-commissioned
officer was killed, a captain of
the Royal Engineers wounded perilously
by the blade of a charah, a subaltern of
native infantry received a ball through his
shoulder, and several Sikhs were killed;
but Spatterdash laid about him vigorously
with his tulwar, split one or two heads
through the long floating loongees like
pumpkins, and brought the party off;
after which General Tytler, at Maidonak
and Girda, burned the two villages, blew
up seven fortified towers, and seized
hostages, to be kept in irons till a heavy fine
was paid.
</p>

<p>
In due time Colville got his V.C. for
the affair with the Mohmunds, and Robert
Wodrow was recommended for promotion,
and, as the coming general war in the
heart of Afghanistan was likely to make
many a vacancy, if spared, he was sure to
get it.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the skirmish at Maidonak
and threatened attacks by the hostile
tribesmen in the vicinity of Jellalabad
and the Lughman Valley, early in March
an expedition was ordered into the latter
quarter, under Major-General Jenkins, and
with it Colville went on the staff.  It
proved a very successful movement, with
many important political consequences.
</p>

<p>
The first news he heard of it was after
a supper in old Spatterdash's bungalow.
</p>

<p>
'Turn in if you can, lads,' said he, when
the cantonment ghurries clanged midnight;
'and I must have a nap, too.  We get
under arms before daylight to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'For what?' asked Colville.
</p>

<p>
'To fight, of course.  Have you not
seen the general orders?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I was at polo all afternoon with
the 10th.  But to fight&mdash;where?'
</p>

<p>
'That depends upon where we find the
enemy, who are gathering as usual for
mischief; so let us have a nightcap of
<i>brandy-pawnee</i>, and then to roost.'
</p>

<p>
Colville stretched himself in a corner
of the bungalow, and was soon in the
Land of Nod.  'The soldier off duty and
the sailor when his watch is over have the
faculty for getting snatches of sleep at a
moment's notice, which is denied to most
other mortals, and a blessed gift it is.'
</p>

<p>
An hour before dawn the bugles sounded,
and the troops detailed for the
expedition fell in.
</p>

<p>
It was then known that the destination
of the force was the Lughman Valley,
where the sirdar Mahmoud Shah was the
active and ruling spirit.
</p>

<p>
Considerable annoyance and mortification
were felt by Colville at the frequently
recurring mention of this personage's
name, the Hadji spy in Jellalabad whom
he had succoured and protected, a circumstance
for which he had been much quizzed
and 'chaffed,' for, as Lever has it, 'a little
bit of fun goes a long way in the army.'
</p>

<p>
'A fine fellow to have fostered, Colville,'
said Colonel Spatterdash, as he mounted;
'd&mdash;n him, he is worse than a Peshawur
scorpion, and we all know what it is, for
size and venom.'
</p>

<p>
While the infantry rolls were called, the
companies proved, and the battalions
formed, the battery of artillery were also
getting in order; the horses were champing
their bits, pawing the ground, and laying
back their ears as if impatient for the
trumpet call.  The gunners stood by
them&mdash;one examining the harness finally to see
that all was right, another altering his
stirrup-leathers by a hole or two, a third
adjusting a comrade's accoutrements, a
fourth grasping the bow of his saddle
ready to mount at the blast of the
trumpet, after which he knew his horse would
no longer remain still; while the trumpeter
stood near the commanding officer,
breathing into the mouthpiece of his brass
instrument, occasionally as if to keep it
ready for sounding.
</p>

<p>
Anon the men are mounted or on the
limber-seats; the trumpet rings out, the
word <i>march</i> is given; the drivers ease the
reins and close their legs to the riding
horses, throwing their whips gently over
the necks of the off-horses so as to ensure
their starting together; and it is a rule in
artillery that the spurs are for the ridden
horse, the whip for the off one, and to be
applied over the shoulder or neck, but
never in the rear of the pad.
</p>

<p>
So the guns went clattering to the front,
and the infantry broke into columns of
march, with a cavalry advance-guard, just
as the sun began to lighten the summit
of the Suffaidh Koh and other snow-clad
mountains.
</p>

<p>
The Lughman Valley lies north of
Jellalabad, and is overlooked by the
Himalayas, though extending to the
lower ridges of the Hindoo Koosh, while
Kaffiristan borders it on the east.
</p>

<p>
Colville, of course, rode with the staff, and
the ill-fated Louis Cavagnari accompanied
it.
</p>

<p>
Many narrow valleys, with torrents
traversing their boulder-strewn beds, and
sides covered with beautiful vegetation,
were passed in succession, with several
villages, each marked by an enormous
chunar or Oriental plane&mdash;perhaps by two
or three placed near each other for shade,
where the Moollah might bring forth his
Koran, and recite it for the information
of others.
</p>

<p>
As the troops proceeded the rocks around
them seemed to grow darker and darker,
owing to the lead ore among them, while
enormous boulders of every kind of stone
were strewn about far away from their
original beds out of which the torrents of
ages past had torn them.
</p>

<p>
Shaggy goats and broad-tailed doombas,
or Persian sheep, were seen grazing near
the villages, where at first the people came
forth peacefully to gaze with wonder upon
the Feringhees.  No untoward event
occurred, till a tribesman drew near where
a party of hussars were halted, carrying
a sharp axe concealed behind his back,
and evidently bent on mischief, as he was
known by his white dress to be a Ghazi,
or fanatic devoted to death.
</p>

<p>
With his weapon, he was about to aim
a blow that must have proved a deadly
one on an unsuspecting corporal, when,
quick as thought, Robert Wodrow, who
had his sword drawn, clove his head to the
teeth.
</p>

<p>
This was a signal for strife.  Alarm fires
soon began to shoot up redly on several
eminences; yells and shouts came upon
the mountain wind from armed parties
mustering fast among the rocks and
eyries and ere long a sputtering fire of
juzails, or native rifles, was opened on the
column, and men began to drop dead or
limp about wounded.
</p>

<p>
Out of these lofty places the tribesmen
were shelled, but not without difficulty,
and ultimately driven by the rifle-fire of
our skirmishers into a narrow, rocky
defile, which proved a kind of natural
cul-de-sac, out of which there was little or no
exit; and there into the wedged mass, shell
after shell at a thousand yards went
smoking and whistling till it plumped and
exploded among them with terrible effect;
but it was necessary to teach these treacherous
people a lesson, and a severe one it
proved.
</p>

<p>
Four days the expedition remained in
the Lughman Valley, and on the fourth,
when passing on the downward route the
place where the conflict had ensued, and
where rifle and shell fire had decimated
the enemy, Colville, who for a
considerable time past had been somewhat
unused to strife and slaughter, looked with
a kind of horror upon the scene around
him.
</p>

<p>
Save the vultures and carrion crows no
living creature had ventured to approach
the gorge where the dead, and dying yet
lay&mdash;a picture of human anguish and
human passions indescribable.
</p>

<p>
The bodies of the torn and mutilated
lay thickly there, either stark and stiff in
the refuge of death, or writhing and
struggling, as if to escape the doom of
those beside them.
</p>

<p>
If this scene seemed dreadful by day,
more dreadful and ghastly did it seem to
those in the rear of the column, who passed
it after nightfall, and the moon shed its
cold light over the Katcha mountains, and
the rear-guard of Hussars, under Redhaven,
had to pick their way amid bodies lying
half-naked, in every conceivable position,
with dark and bloody faces on the broad
and ghastly grin, distorted and battered
limbs, with clenched hands and staring
open eyes; while some of the dead sat bolt
upright against rocks and boulders, with
jaws dropped, and stiffened fingers grimly
pointing at vacancy.
</p>

<p>
The next expedition towards the Lughman
Valley was marked by a terrible
disaster, the story of which went through
the length and breadth of the British
Isles.
</p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE FANCY BALL.
</h3>

<p>
From such a scene as that in the Lughman
Valley we gladly turn to one of a very
different kind.
</p>

<p>
It was an evening of the early days of
April, when the elms begin to show their
half-developed foliage, the buds of the oak
are red, and the sprays of the beech gleam
like emeralds against the blue sky, and the
laburnum is clothed in green and gold,
that Mary and Ellinor Wellwood sat in a
beautiful flower garden while idling over
some 'crewel work,' and watching a glorious
sunset as it shone on the broad waters
of the Elbe.
</p>

<p>
We have said that for change of air and
of scene Mrs. Deroubigne, who acted to
them as a second mother, had taken them
with her to the Continent, and, after
wandering through France and Holland, they
now found themselves installed in a pretty
villa near Altona, about two miles from
the gay, busy, and hospitable city of
Hamburg, whose merchants are so famous for
the excellence of their dinners, and the
splendour of their entertainments.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely spring evening; the
Elbe, studded with shipping under sail or
steam, was rolling in light, its blue
blending into crimson; and beyond it lay the
low, green hills of Hanover, now no longer
a petty kingdom, but an integral portion
of the great German empire.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting, and such a sunset!
</p>

<p>
Separated from Hamburg only by a
space called the Field of the Holy Ghost,
where daily the spike-helmeted Prussian
troops could be seen at drill, the wharves
and warehouses of Altona join those of the
city, as they stretch along the waterside
with stately rows of pale green poplars
behind them.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the last of these, in a little
wooded creek, and on the summit of a
green bank overlooking the river, stood
the charming little villa occupied
temporarily by Mrs. Deroubigne, from the
windows of which the great panorama of the
Hansetown was visible, with the lofty
red-brick tower of St. Michael's Kirk (a
hundred feet higher than the dome of
St. Paul's at London), bathed in ruddy gold,
and casting its mighty shadow half-way
to Altona; and, as the evening sky grew
redder, the spires of St. Katharine and
St. Nicholai grew redder too; and now,
impressed by the beauty of the evening and
of the scene, the influence of the season
and the soft purity of the ambient air, the
two girls, in the new happiness of their
hearts, sang together a duet from 'Il
Flauto Magico,' of Mozart, all unaware
that a young Prussian officer&mdash;a smart
uhlan, in bright green uniform&mdash;was
lingering admiringly near them.
</p>

<p>
We need scarcely mention, though Hamburg
is famous for the beauty of its women,
the officers of the garrison, the uhlans, and
the Hanoverian infantry in the Dammthor
Barracks always welcomed the appearance
of the two 'charming English meeses' and
their handsome chaperone at the consul's
balls, the opera, the <i>fêtes</i> in the Botanischer
Garten, or when the bands played in the
fashionable Jungfernstieg (or Maiden's
Walk), the beautiful tree-shaded
promenade by the side of the Alster, which is
always covered with gaily-painted
pleasure-boats.
</p>

<p>
These amusements, with fancy work,
music, and novels&mdash;Tauchnitz editions, of
course&mdash;made the sweet spring days pass
quickly with Mary and Ellinor in that gay
city, where, it is said, that in summer the
inhabitants appear to work all day and
amuse themselves all night.
</p>

<p>
Before their departure to the Continent,
great had been the astonishment of Lady
Dunkeld and the fair Blanche Galloway
when they heard of the near relationship
of Colville to the sisters, of his
engagement to Mary, and that they were to be
chaperoned by Mrs. Deroubigne till the
marriage came to pass.
</p>

<p>
'The marriage!'  How Blanche elevated
her eyebrows and shrugged her shoulders.
It was bitter to lose thus the future Lord
Colville of Ochiltree.
</p>

<p>
Both those aristocratic ladies would fain
have extended their patronage and
countenance to the sisters now; but, aware of
their past malevolence, Mary and Ellinor,
though far from revengeful, steadily
declined all intercourse with them. Nor did
Mrs. Deroubigne attempt to control their
actions or wishes in the matter.  Thus a
coldness amounting almost to a 'cut'
ensued between her and the Dunkeld family.
</p>

<p>
Leslie Colville's last letter to Mary from
Jellalabad had narrated the episode of his
meeting with Robert Wodrow, and the
mutual good services they had done each
other; and Mary, who had read of the
personal conflict in the war correspondent's
news, felt her heart sink within her at the
contemplation of the many and incessant
perils her lover&mdash;her affianced
husband&mdash;had to encounter.
</p>

<p>
And how often did Mary recall their
parting, when he had held her face
tenderly and caressingly between his hands
while he gazed down into her tear-blinded
eyes, so sweetly and so passionately, posed
as they both were like the pair in 'the
Huguenot' of Millais's picture; while she
looked up to him as sweetly and as
passionately too.
</p>

<p>
His departure had seemed to Mary but
the beginning of the end.  Yet who could
foresee amid the terrible contingencies of
war and climate what that end might be?
</p>

<p>
Thankful she felt as each day passed,
and with it a portion of the time of
separation; but who might know what that
day had seen or brought forth far, far
away among the wild mountains of Afghanistan?
And so, with curious and persistent
ingenuity, thoughtful and anxious fancy
often tormented her.
</p>

<p>
Yet under different influences and
happier auspices, and amid new scenes, both
sisters regained the old glow of health and
beauty they had possessed each in her own
degree in former days at pleasant
Birkwoodbrae.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile with Ellinor, as the conviction
of her own sudden selfishness and
folly grew strong in her heart, and the
now odious image of Sir Redmond Sleath
faded out of it, the memory of Robert
Wodrow and of other days took their place
there; but what would that avail either
of them now?
</p>

<p>
The sisters ceased their duet suddenly,
when Jack the fox-terrier, who had been
nestling against Mary's skirts, started up
to greet with many a yelp of delight the
young officer who fed him so often with
biscuits and chocolate creams.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon my interrupting a song so
sweet,' said he, in good English, 'but my
purpose must be my excuse,' he added,
with a military salute, for the Baron
Rolandsburg&mdash;a visitor of Mrs. Deroubigne's&mdash;belonged
to the Uhlans, and, like all
Prussian officers, was seldom or never
seen out of uniform, the green laced with
gold of the dashing Lancers.
</p>

<p>
He was a fair-haired and handsome man,
barely thirty years of age, and in his
fifteenth year had the glory of being the
first Prussian to enter Paris, for he it was
who galloped his horse amid scowling and
assembled thousands through the Arc de
Triomphe after winning the iron cross at
Sedan; and now he had brought 'for
Madame Deroubigne' and her two young
ladies, tickets for a most exclusive fancy
ball, to be given in the Theatre of
Hamburg, which is one of the largest in
Germany; for, though there are many public
ball-rooms in that pleasure-loving city,
they are never patronised by the upper
classes.
</p>

<p>
The baron had been the sisters' escort
to all 'the lions' of Hamburg&mdash;to the
churches, the stately and crowded <i>Börse</i>,
to Rœdings Museum, the tomb of Klopstock,
the great garden kept by a Scotsman
at Wandsbeck, overlooked by the house of
Tycho Brahe, and they had lingered again
and again on the summit of the Stintfang,
from whence there is such an extensive
view of the harbour, the Elbe, and the
opposite coast of Hanover, and his hand
had often assisted Ellinor in her sketches
of the Vierlanders in their picturesque
costume and of their boats laden with
glowing fruit, flowers, and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deroubigne deemed there was no
harm in all this.  It amused the girls,
drew them from their own sad thoughts,
and so far as she could see the admiration
and attention of the young baron were
pretty equally divided between them, or if
he had a preference it was for Mary, as it
seemed ere long.
</p>

<p>
But the tickets for the fancy ball&mdash;a
ball of a kind so peculiarly flattering to
female vanity and taste in costume and so
forth&mdash;seemed to crown all his previous
good offices and kindness, and they accepted
them with a genuine delight that quite
flattered him.
</p>

<p>
Bouquets (selected by those pretty Vierlander
flower girls, whose picturesque caps
and embroidered bodices make them quite
a feature in Hamburg), gloves, music, even
a fan or two, had come from the Baron
Rolandsburg, but always at appropriate
times, with reference to a stall at the opera
or an afternoon dance.
</p>

<p>
There was no reason why Mary should
not accept such gifts; yet she would rather
that they did not come, as their acceptance
seemed a kind of treason to him who was
then so far, far away.
</p>

<p>
For some days their fancy dresses were
an all engrossing source of thought and
topic with the girls and their chaperone;
but, after many changes of mind, costumes
of the reign of Mary Stuart were selected
by them, Mary choosing blue, slashed and
trimmed with white, as suited to her
blonde complexion, and Ellinor rose
colour, trimmed and slashed with black, as
suited to her dark hair and hazel eyes,
and wonderfully handsome and piquante
they looked.
</p>

<p>
On the forenoon of the ball the baron
arrived with three magnificent bouquets
and two beautiful fans for the sisters&mdash;the
best that could be obtained in the Neuer
Wall.
</p>

<p>
'How charming&mdash;how kind!' exclaimed
both, blushing with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'For our dance to-night,' said Rolandsburg,
in his most insinuating tone, to
Mary, 'how many waltzes are you to give
me?' he asked, in a lower voice.
</p>

<p>
'How many do you want?' asked Mary,
coquettishly.
</p>

<p>
'I would like them all of course&mdash;save
those I may have with Miss Ellinor; but
that is too much to expect.'
</p>

<p>
As all this implied more than words,
Mary appeared not to hear, and addressed
Mrs. Deroubigne.
</p>

<p>
In due time they were attired, and
drove through the brilliantly lighted
streets to the Stadt Theatre in the
Dammthor Strasse, where the Burgher Guard,
in quaint uniforms, were under arms to
receive the burgomasters and four
Syndics of the city, who wear on state
occasions high-crowned hats and black
velvet cloaks, with ruffs and swords;
and there, about the entrances, were a
crowd of blooming Vierlander flower-girls,
selling bouquets and button-holes,
their quaint hats or gold-embroidered caps,
their bodices of crimson or black, covered
with gold-broidery, and their short blue
skirts, making each a picture.
</p>

<p>
'I shall dance with no one else but you
to-night,' said the uhlan, in his softest
tone, to Mary.
</p>

<p>
'No one else?' said she.
</p>

<p>
'Save your sister.'
</p>

<p>
'Our poor uhlan is evidently playing
with edged tools, Mary,' said Mrs. Deroubigne,
with a smile, while the baron was
intently pencilling on their programmes
and his own.
</p>

<p>
The stage and floored pit of the theatre,
which had been converted into one vast,
brilliantly lighted and gaily decorated hall,
was filling fast with guests in every real
and fanciful costume that can be conceived,
and already the great orchestra in their
places were playing a kind of overture;
but their music was to be alternated by
the great brass band of the uhlans; and,
though many handsome, even rarely beautiful
girls were present, Mary and Ellinor
Wellwood were remarked amid them all.
</p>

<p>
'Schön! schön!' (beautiful, beautiful)
muttered many, as they passed to their
appointed place with Mrs. Deroubigne.
</p>

<p>
'En verité!' exclaimed a gallant little
French consul; 'ces dames sont charmantes!'
</p>

<p>
But the ball itself has less to do with
our story than what it preluded.
</p>

<p>
Many of the dresses were gorgeous in
texture and decoration&mdash;silk, velvet, gold
and silver jewellery, and the richest lace,
fairy-like in delicacy of fashion and tint,
and when the dancers in hundreds flew
round in the waltz it seemed a glimpse of
the land of Elphin.
</p>

<p>
The music was divine, and Mary felt
every nerve and fibre of her frame respond
to it as she sped round with slippered feet
over the well-waxed floor on the arm of
Rolandsburg, whose step and time suited
hers to perfection.
</p>

<p>
There were beautiful Jewish matrons
from the fashionable mansions on the
Alster Damm, with broods of black-eyed
and equally beautiful daughters; for the
Jewish ladies of Hamburg, in style, beauty,
and delicacy of feature, excel all others of
their race; but the blonde beauties of
Holstein and North Germany far exceeded
them in numbers and glow of complexion.
</p>

<p>
Off the dancing-hall were artificial
conservatories and refreshment-rooms for
ice-cream, jelly, and flirtation, where servants
were in attendance clad like Turks, with
turbans and slippers, pistols and yataghans,
and where, with a sound like file-firing,
the champagne corks flew up to the gilded
ceilings.
</p>

<p>
Amid the dazzling scene, as Mary paused
in a waltz, panting, palpitating, and
blushing to see her own reflection in a mirror,
as she almost clung to the arm of the
baron in his green uhlan uniform, and
found herself the object of so much
attention and admiration, her mind reverted
with a kind of dull and painful wonder to
the past days of their obscure abode in
frowsy Paddington; to her struggles for
employment, and her lonely wanderings in
unfamiliar streets, where often her beauty
subjected her to such observation and
insolent annoyance that often she longed to
be old and ugly; and when her chief hope
had been to fill the place of governess to
some one's children&mdash;well-bred or ill-bred,
yet not without a faint vision of future
good fortune, position, and admiration&mdash;perhaps
even riches; she was too young
to be without such fancies and hopes.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor thought she would never forget
the splendours and enjoyments of the
fancy dress ball; in all its features and
details it was so new to her, and from a
subsequent event she was fated to
remember it long.
</p>

<p>
The baron, always attentive and full of
<i>empressement</i>, was enchanted to be the
privileged cavalier to two such English
belles.
</p>

<p>
Mary, in her piquant Mary Stuart cap,
with a little ruff round her delicate neck,
her sleeves puffed and slashed, her peaked
bodice, all blue satin, with seed pearls,
quite dazzled him, and matured the passion
for her that was growing in his heart;
and at last, in the intervals of the dances,
though he yielded her with undisguised
reluctance to other uhlans, dragoons, and
gunners, who crowded about her,
programme in hand, he ventured to speak
on the subject&mdash;not to her, but to
Mrs. Deroubigne, and thus spared her some
pain and confusion.
</p>

<p>
'Madame,' said he, while conducting her
to a refreshment-room, 'you evidently love
these two young ladies as if they were
your own daughters!'
</p>

<p>
'I do indeed&mdash;and they might have
been,' was the somewhat enigmatical reply
of Mrs. Deroubigne, with one of her bright
sweet smiles.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! who would not love them, the
blue-eyed one especially.'
</p>

<p>
'Mary?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, madame.  I thought generally that
love only existed in plays and novels.'
</p>

<p>
'And when were you undeceived?'
</p>

<p>
'When first I knew <i>her</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Baron, you must dismiss such thoughts,'
said Mrs. Deroubigne, with some dismay.
</p>

<p>
'Why, madame?' he asked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'The young lady is engaged.'
</p>

<p>
'Engaged&mdash;is that betrothed?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
His countenance changed instantly.
</p>

<p>
'To an officer&mdash;a dear friend of mine&mdash;now
in Afghanistan.'
</p>

<p>
'In Afghanistan!' he repeated, angrily;
'a <i>fiancé</i> there is next to no <i>fiancé</i> at all,
for a bullet may&mdash;nay,' said he, pausing,
'this thought is ungenerous of me, and I
would not like another to think thus of
Rolandsburg.  Gott in Himmel, how
unlucky I am!'
</p>

<p>
'I am so sorry to hear all this.'
</p>

<p>
'So am I&mdash;so am I,' exclaimed the baron,
pulling his long fair moustaches, for a
betrothal in Germany gives a young girl a
kind of wife-like sanctity among the homely
and domestic Teutonic people; and
Mrs. Deroubigne, who dearly loved the romantic,
felt for him; the young man's hopes had
been cruelly crushed at the very moment
when he thought them brightest.
</p>

<p>
'One cannot have everything they
want&mdash;it is not given to anyone on earth
to be perfectly happy, I suppose,' said he,
with a sigh, and there was a sadness, with
a ring of sincerity, in his voice that
certainly touched Mrs. Deroubigne.
</p>

<p>
'Have you spoken of love to her?' whispered
she, behind her fan; 'but I hope not!'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I have never spoken&mdash;but she
must have inferred what I felt,' replied
the baron, who, like most German officers,
spoke English well.
</p>

<p>
'Inferred it&mdash;I scarcely think so, with
her mind so occupied with the thoughts of
another.'
</p>

<p>
'But, any way, I think it does a girl
good to know that a man loves her; and
then, if the proverb be true about one love
begetting another, she may incline her
heart to him.'
</p>

<p>
'Not in this instance, baron.'
</p>

<p>
For Rolandsburg now the charm of the
ball was over; the music sounded faint,
the lights seemed dim, and he was glad
when the great festivity ended, and he,
after escorting the ladies to their carriage,
took his way slowly through the streets to
his barracks near the Dammthor Wall.
</p>

<p>
For his disappointment&mdash;and it was a
sudden and sore one&mdash;he had no one but
himself to blame, he felt, as Mary
Wellwood had never given him the least
encouragement to fling his heart away as
he had done.
</p>

<p>
And now for the sequel to the night's
adventures.
</p>

<p>
Talking gaily, as girls will talk after a
ball, criticising costumes and partners, and
comparing notes, Mary, Ellinor, and
Mrs. Deroubigne reached home when day was
beginning to dawn, and the blue waters of
the Elbe were beginning to brighten.
Ellinor, teasing and quizzing Mary about
the baron, had been singing to her&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Ilka lassie has her laddie,<br />
  But ne'er a one have I;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and Mary, in hot haste, anxious to see the
very latest news, threw open a London
paper which had come over night, but, as
she eagerly scanned it, a cry of dismay
escaped her as she read a brief telegram:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'<i>Terrible disaster to the 10th Hussars.&mdash;A
whole squadron drowned in the Cabul River,
and two officers, when attempting to save the
life of Corporal Wodrow.</i>'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The hearts of the sisters stood still as
they read and re-read this startling notice.
</p>

<p>
The attempt to save Robert Wodrow
had evidently been a failure&mdash;so he was
gone!
</p>

<p>
Who had made the attempt and perished
with him?  Mary's agitated mind at once
suggested Colville.  Both girls felt
completely stunned.
</p>

<p>
The returning and growing love&mdash;a love
blended with great pity&mdash;that had been
developing itself in Ellinor's heart for poor
Robert Wodrow was now absorbed and
swallowed up in a gush of bitterness and
intense remorse at being the cause of his
sorrowful and untimely fate.
</p>

<p>
How true it is that 'suffering is our
most faithful friend; it is always returning.
Often has it changed its dress, and
even its face; but we can easily recognise
it by its cordial and intimate embrace.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And how was it, then, at the old ivy-clad
manse of Kirktown-Mailler, where the
same terrible telegram had gone like the
dart of death?
</p>

<p>
There the blinds were drawn down, as if
the hussar who had found his grave in the
Cabul River was lying dead in the bed he
had slept on in boyhood and manhood,
and across which his mother now lay
stretched in hopeless grief.
</p>

<p>
And a sad-eyed and sympathetic
congregation watched the venerable minister
when, with bent eyes, and slow, unsteady
steps, he entered his pulpit next Sunday.
</p>

<p>
All knew the dire calamity that had
befallen him, and one and all their kindly
Scottish hearts bled for him, when his
voice failed, his sermon escaped him, and
stretching out his trembling hands on the
pulpit cushion, he bent down his handsome
old head upon them&mdash;a head now white as
the thistledown&mdash;and begged his people to
excuse him, 'as all night long he had been
in the Valley of the Shadow of Death!'
</p>

<p>
Then his elders led him into the vestry,
and those who saw him descending the
stair of that pulpit, wherein he had
ministered unto them faithfully for more than
thirty years, never forgot the painful
episode.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
THE 10TH HUSSARS.
</h3>

<p>
And now to detail how the catastrophe
referred to came about.
</p>

<p>
The evening of Monday, the 31st of
March, saw Leslie Colville in his saddle,
and busy conveying orders in the camp
and cantonments of Jellalabad, where
drum and bugle gave the notes of
preparation for the field.
</p>

<p>
This was between five and six o'clock,
when two columns were suddenly ordered
out for another expedition towards the
Lughman Valley.
</p>

<p>
One, to be led by Brigadier Gough, was
to consist of seven hundred men furnished
by the 17th and 27th regiments, three
hundred native infantry, four Royal Horse
Artillery guns under Major Stewart, and
two squadrons of the dashing Guide
Cavalry.
</p>

<p>
This column, according to the orders
repeated by Colville, was to march out at
one o'clock next morning.
</p>

<p>
'In what direction?' asked old Spatterdash
and others.
</p>

<p>
'I know not,' replied Colville; 'but
Lughman, I suppose, is the object in view
with it, as well as the other column, under
Brigadier Macpherson.'
</p>

<p>
The command of the latter consisted of
three hundred Rifles, six hundred Ghoorkas
and Punjaubees, with a mountain battery
under Lieutenant E. J. de Lautour, of the
Royal Artillery, who had served in the
expedition of 1863 against the tribes on
the North-West Frontier, some sappers,
and a squadron each from the 10th Hussars
and 11th Bengal Lancers, who, like the
former corps, wear blue uniforms faced
with red and laced with gold.
</p>

<p>
The latter column was to be in readiness
to march at nine that evening, with four
days' provisions in the haversacks.
</p>

<p>
The moon, in a sky flecked with clouds,
was gleaming brightly on the Balla Hissar,
the domes and walls of Jellalabad, though
it was little more than a quarter old, as
Macpherson's column got under arms;
and the rolls were called, the ammunition
served out, the inspection of saddlery and
accoutrements was proceeded with.
</p>

<p>
Our soldiers always muster merrily for
work such as they had in hand that night;
and, before they were called to attention.
Redhaven had on more than one occasion
to speak almost sharply to Robert Wodrow,
who was&mdash;for him, at least&mdash;unusually
noisy and jubilant.
</p>

<p>
'Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow
we die!' he heard him say.
</p>

<p>
'Can't make that countryman of yours
out, Colville,' said the hussar-officer, as he
scraped a vesta and lit a cigar.  'He is
usually the most silent and taciturn fellow
in the troop, and to-night he makes as much
noise as all the Ghoorkas put together.'
</p>

<p>
'And that puzzles you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; he looks like a man with a past.'
</p>

<p>
'He has indeed a past history, poor
fellow, a sorrowful and not a happy one.'
</p>

<p>
'Every broken-down fellow takes to the
cavalry now,' grumbled Redhaven; 'but I
was certain he has some secret by the
expression of his eyes, and the inflections
of his modulated voice at times.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow!' said Colville again.
</p>

<p>
He knew, what Redhaven did not, that
Robert Wodrow was often a prey to sad
and bitter thoughts; that in the dreams of
the night and of the day when asleep in
the wet-flapping tent or the comfortless
bivouac&mdash;when on solitary vidette duty,
under the blazing Afghan sun, he saw
oftener before him&mdash;not the fair face of
her for whom he had sacrificed everything,
and whom, he doubted not, would soon
become the bride of another&mdash;but the face
of his loving mother&mdash;a kind and happy
old face&mdash;that ever beamed with love for
him; and opposite her fancy saw his
silver-haired old father, reading some good or
musty volume&mdash;Wodrow's <i>Analecta Scotica</i>
perhaps; and often from such visions of
home he was roused by the trumpet
blowing 'boot and saddle,' or the yell of an
Afghan scout armed with <i>juzail</i> and <i>charah</i>.
</p>

<p>
As a Scotsman, Colville was superstitious
enough to regret that at such a time
the young fellow should show such exuberance
of spirits as the foreboding of evil,
and was in the act of urging his horse
forward to accost him kindly, when the
brigadier came on the ground, the
component parts of the column were called to
'attention,' and in a few minutes after, the
whole force was on the march, and, with
the glittering of sword and bayonet blades,
section after section quickly disappeared
from the eyes of those who watched them
in the cold wintry moonshine that had
turned to diamonds the thick hoarfrost on
every wall and tree; and the march began
which was to prove the last to many in
this life.
</p>

<p>
'The line of ground between Jellalabad
and Cabul, so far as it is connected with
India,' says a writer, 'is a line of tragedy
and misfortune.  That line of tragedy and
misfortune may now be extended a couple
of miles further to the east, for that will
give very nearly the point where forty-six
lives were on that Monday evening suddenly
swept out of existence.'
</p>

<p>
The troops moved westward, the cavalry
leading.  The squadron of the 10th Hussars
was under Captain D'Esterre Spottiswoode,
that of the Bengal Lancers was under its
own captain, and Major E. A. Wood of the
first-named corps commanded the whole.
</p>

<p>
Guided by an Afghan mountaineer who
had offered his services, and to whom Colville
paid a high bribe therefor, the orders
of the officers were to cross the Cabul
river at a point where most unluckily a
temporary bridge had shortly before been
removed.  On achieving that, they were
to move up the left bank of the stream, to
march through Besoot and Darunta, and
enter the Lughman Valley, to which the
infantry were moving by the Jellalabad
side of the Cabul.
</p>

<p>
The guide, who was mounted on a
powerful and wiry yaboo, or Cabul pony,
was a singularly taciturn fellow, and
Colville remarked a circumstance which
soon became a painful memory, that by
twisting the end of his loonghee, or
head-dress, across the lower part of his face he
effectually concealed his features, permitting
little more than his keen, black, and
glittering eyes to be seen, reminding him
of the muffled men he had read of in old
Scottish Border forays.
</p>

<p>
Macpherson's column had not been long
gone when the troops at the camp of
Jellalabad were roused and alarmed by
numbers of cavalry horses, all riderless,
galloping wildly among the tents, with
their bridles trailing, and their saddles,
valises, and trappings soaked in water.
</p>

<p>
'What has happened&mdash;what can have
happened?' were the questions asked on
every side.
</p>

<p>
No one could anticipate the catastrophe
that had really occurred, as at that season
the bed of the Cabul is not always full;
but when the sun melts the accumulated
snow in the Katcha range and other
mountains it is not so.  The water then rolls
through many channels, and it was in
anticipation of this that the wooden bridge
had been removed to a point further up.
</p>

<p>
Where our cavalry were to cross at the
Fort of Isaac, the stream now formed two
branches; the first was thirty feet broad,
with an average of only thirty inches of
water, and the crossing was to be made
under the light of a dim and fitful moon,
at a point where an irrigation channel
diverged at right angles from the stream.
Beyond that point stood a kind of sandy
islet covered with great boulders, and
again beyond it lay a hundred and fifty
feet of water; but as the line of this fatal
ford was <i>not straight</i>, three hundred and
fifty feet of water had to be traversed upon
it, as the ford formed at one point an
acute angle.
</p>

<p>
Led by the local guides, the squadron of
Bengal Lancers crossed in safety, wheeling
at the given point on the acute angle.
</p>

<p>
The mules of the squadron followed
next, our hussars, now riding at ease,
waiting till their turn came to cross; and
to amuse the rest, one of them, the
identical Toby Chace, who was one of Robert
Wodrow's earliest comrades, and well
known as a reckless fellow, began to sing
a soldier's ditty, part of which ran thus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'There's Bill Muggins left our village,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as sound a man as I;<br />
  Now he goes about on crutches,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single arm and eye.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To be sure he's got a medal<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some twenty pounds a year<br />
  For his health, and strength, and service,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government can't call that dear;<br />
  Not to reckon one leg shattered,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ribs broken, one eye lost;<br />
  'Fore I went in such a venture,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should stop and count the cost.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Lots o' glory, lots o' gammon&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Silence there&mdash;in front!' cried the
commanding officer, and Colville, who had
some undefinable suspicion of the hussar
guide, placed himself near that personage,
with his revolver case loose and at hand.
</p>

<p>
'Do not lose the direction, men,' cried
an officer, 'but keep well up against the
stream,' he added, knowing that when
crossing thus there is always a tendency
to edge lower down with the current.
</p>

<p>
The leading sections began to enter the
stream, the rippling eddies of which went
past them, tipped with silver by the pale
moonlight; the rest followed closely, the
guide directing, and erelong Colville and
others found the water rising to their feet,
then it rose as high as their knees, and
was beginning to get higher, while the
pony of the guide had quitted the angled
line of the ford, and was swimming away
to another point.
</p>

<p>
'Treachery,' thought Colville; at that
moment the <i>loonghee</i> fell from the face of
the guide, and he recognised Mahmoud
Shah, the sirdir with the slashed
cheek&mdash;Mahmoud, the hadji, whom he had saved
from the Wahabees!
</p>

<p>
'This is getting awkward!' exclaimed
Redhaven, 'there must be some mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'We are betrayed!' cried Colville.
</p>

<p>
He put his hand to his pistol-case, but
too late, for now his horse rolled over, and
with an exulting shriek in English of
'Pigs! dogs! Kaffirs!&mdash;drown and be
damned!  Eblis and hell await you!  In
vain will ye seek the Lord of the
Daybreak!' cried the treacherous guide; then
he reached the Jellalabad side in safety and
vanished&mdash;pony and all.
</p>

<p>
All was confusion, consternation, and
death now, for the water, flowing at the
rate of nine miles an hour, had risen to
the saddle bows and holsters of the Hussars,
whose spirited horses, finding their footing
gone, ignored the use of spur and bridle.
</p>

<p>
The line of the ford was lost now; the
current pouring over it soon forced the
horses downward into deeper water, sweeping
the squadron away towards the swifter
rapids, and in a mass of confusion our
gallant Hussars, with their terrified horses,
were struggling desperately and madly for
existence, under the dim moonlight and
amid the fiercely rushing waters, while the
bewildered Bengal Lancers could only sit
in their saddles and look helplessly on.
</p>

<p>
An officer whose horse had kicked Robert
Wodrow, rendering him nearly insensible,
failed to escape, and both were swept away,
so, natheless, his reckless quotation from
St. Luke's Gospel, there was to be no
'to-morrow' for the latter.
</p>

<p>
Captain D'Esterre Spottiswoode&mdash;afterwards
colonel&mdash;was mounted on a very
splendid and powerful horse, which was
able to swim well, and bore him to the
other bank in safety, but not to the end of
the ford.
</p>

<p>
In dangerous quicksands it sank twice
to its girth, on the last occasion falling on
its rider, whose head was thrust so far
below water that he was nearly drowned
ere he scrambled breathlessly to dry land.
</p>

<p>
Colville, who had been riding with the
captain and three subalterns at the head
of the troop, which mustered seventy-six
sabres, felt his horse become restive when
the water flowed over his holsters; the
animal kicked and plunged till at last he
was thrown off its back, and found himself
floundering in deep water.  Being a
good swimmer he thought to get rid of
his sword and belt, but failed, as he sank
each time in making the attempt, and each
time he came to the surface with an
invocation to heaven on his lips.
</p>

<p>
The men in the squadron were all in
heavy marching order, fully accoutred and
supplied with ammunition&mdash;circumstances
sufficient to drag down a good swimmer
even in smooth water.  Nearly all were
thrown by their terrified horses, which, as
they rolled over and over, lashed out with
their hoofs, maiming and stunning many
of our poor fellows as they were swept
into the dark rushing current of the
rapids, and where these ceased lay a little
pool of deep water, and there it was that
all who had strength left to struggle
succeeded in reaching the land, but many
failed, alas!
</p>

<p>
As Colville was swept downward, while
in the desperate agonies of seeking to save
his own life, he could take in the terrible
details of the tragedy, and saw how the
river was crowded with men, horses, and
white helmets rolling past; how heads,
hands, and spurred heels rose momentarily
and vanished to rise again, and then sink
for ever beneath the cruel and greedy
current.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this scene of death and horror,
there came not one cry from our perishing
hussars; each battled with the waters
of the hostile river as they would have
battled with the Afghans.
</p>

<p>
Colville struck out to reach the bank,
after he sank a third time; but, encumbered
by his heavy boots and putties (or
leg bandages), his sword, revolver, and
ammunition, he was unable to keep himself
afloat, and the agony of a helpless
death was in his heart!
</p>

<p>
He knew that at the time all this was
happening Mary Wellwood would probably
be sleeping, sweetly and peacefully,
on her pillow; and even in that moment
of supreme anguish and terror, he wished
that if death came, his soul might flash
home to her in a dream&mdash;a farewell dream!
</p>

<p>
He felt himself sinking at last, as he had
only been getting occasional breaths of
air; the last of his strength seemed going,
and all hope with it, when suddenly his
feet touched the bottom, and a prayer rose
to his lips.
</p>

<p>
Rousing himself for a final effort, he
pushed forward, and hope began again to
dawn on him as he found the water
getting shallower; but he was too weak to
reach the river's bank, and, grasping some
wild jasmine trailers that grew between
two boulders, he propped himself up to
rest and breathe.
</p>

<p>
At this point, seeing neither man nor
horse near him, he thought that all must
have perished&mdash;perished through the
diabolical hatred and treachery of Mahmoud
Shah!
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he heard a voice cry out,
</p>

<p>
'Is this you, Captain Colville?'
</p>

<p>
The questioner, whose grammar was not
very choice, proved to be the hussar Toby
Chace, who was sitting bareheaded, dripping,
and disconsolate on the river bank.
</p>

<p>
Colville was almost voiceless, so Toby
waded in, and assisted him to dry land,
where he could scarcely stand from
exhaustion, but was able ultimately, with
the assistance of Chace, to reach the camp,
where he found that his horse had arrived
before him.
</p>

<p>
All the troop horses were heard to snort
wildly as the current swept them away,
and, being overweighted by their saddles,
the slung carbines, and other trappings,
they beat the air with their hoofs as
they rolled about; but only twelve were
drowned.
</p>

<p>
When the roll was called, forty-six
hussars, who would never hear it again,
were missing, with Lieutenant Harford
and another officer.  Many of their bodies,
when found, showed broken limbs, the result
of kicks from iron-shod hoofs, and many
of them had their hands raised to their
heads, either for protection or through
pain from blows, and in that position
they had stiffened in death.
</p>

<p>
One poor fellow was swept a long way
down the Cabul river, but clambered into
a native boat, where he was found next
day, dead from exhaustion and cold.
</p>

<p>
'An awful calamity!  A devil of a
business!'
</p>

<p>
'How did it happen?  Whose fault was it?'
</p>

<p>
Such were a few of the exclamations
heard on every hand in camp, from whence,
on the first arrival of the riderless horses,
soldiers had rushed to the river side with
lanterns and ropes, and staff-surgeons with
restoratives.
</p>

<p>
Ten rupees reward was offered for every
body recovered from that fatal river, and
some were buried severally near the places
where they were found.  Colville made
many inquiries about that of Robert
Wodrow, as the one in whom he was personally
most interested, but no trace of him
could be discovered.
</p>

<p>
In one eddy of the river nineteen of
our gallant hussars were found huddled
together in one ghastly heap.
</p>

<p>
These and the bodies of others were all
buried in one vast grave at the western
end of the camp; and those who saw that
solemn scene&mdash;that grim row of bodies,
each rolled in a blanket, and lying side
by side in close ranks, shoulder to
shoulder&mdash;never forgot it.
</p>

<p>
Neither did they forget the funeral
service of the following evening, when
the body of Lieutenant Francis H. Harford
and that of a private of the Leicestershire
Regiment, who had been mortally
wounded in action, were interred about
dusk.
</p>

<p>
Solemn and strikingly impressive was
the episode.
</p>

<p>
The red Afghan sun had set amid dim
and sombre clouds beyond the snow-clad
summits of the Ramkoond Mountains, but
some ruddy light yet lingered on the
awful peaks of the Suffaidh Koh.  There
had been rain and thunder all afternoon,
and the clouds were gathered in sombre
masses that were edged by the radiance
of the now nearly full moon.
</p>

<p>
Athwart the clouds ever and anon shot
gleams of ghastly lightning, producing
strange and sudden effects of light and
shade, adding to the weird effect of the
funeral cortége&mdash;the coffins on gun-carriages,
draped with the Union Jack, followed
by officers and other mourners in
long, spectral-like cloaks, preceded by the
dark-clad band of the Rifle Brigade playing
a low and wailing dirge-like piece of
music.
</p>

<p>
So ended the tragedy of the 10th Hussars.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, in perfect ignorance of
that event, our troops under Macpherson
and Gough had proceeded to the scene of
their services elsewhere, to fight the
Khugianis and win the battle of Futteabad,
which, as Leslie Colville was not present,
lies somewhat apart from our story.
</p>

<p>
After the defeat of the Khugianis and
the subsequent dispersal of the Afreedis,
the summer of the year was drawing on,
and as Yakoub Khan showed a disposition
to come to terms with Great Britain, and
the hostilities seemed to be drawing to a
close, Leslie Colville began fondly to hope
that he might with honour resign his
appointment for 'special service,' and return
home after the treaty of peace was signed.
</p>

<p>
The negotiations for the latter were
placed in the hands of Major Louis Cavagnari,
and, after some hesitation on the
part of the new Ameer, it was eventually
signed in the British camp at Gundamack&mdash;that
place of ill-omen, where the Red
Hill of <i>Lal Teebah</i> marks the spot on
which the last men of Elphinston's army
perished under Afghan steel in the year
1842.
</p>

<p>
Its chief objects were to place the
foreign affairs of Afghanistan under British
control, and to guarantee that country
against Russian aggression by the aid
of our money, arms, and troops, to
provide for the maintenance of a British
Embassy in the dominions of the Ameer,
and other details.
</p>

<p>
Thus the war came to an end&mdash;as Mary
Wellwood, with many more at home, read
with joy, and our troops in the valley of
Jellalabad were withdrawn within the new
frontier, lest the prolonged presence of
foreigners might inflame the ready
susceptibilities of the fiery Afghans, and render
them less amenable to the influence of
Ayoub Khan.
</p>

<p>
For some reasons the latter was suffered
to depart from Gundamack to Cabul
alone, and the despatch thither of a
British resident was deferred for a time.
When the time came, Leslie Colville&mdash;afterwards
to his own great regret&mdash;instead
of resigning and returning home,
suffered himself to be named in general
orders as one of the staff to accompany
the new Resident&mdash;Major, then Sir Louis
Cavagnari&mdash;on that perilous and, as it
proved, most fatal and calamitous mission,
and when Mary heard of it she sighed
bitterly with apprehension, she knew not of
what.
</p>

<p>
'He should not have allowed himself to
be thus prevailed upon&mdash;surely he has
done enough for honour, by winning his
Victoria Cross!' exclaimed Mrs. Deroubigne,
with surprise, and poor Mary quite
agreed with her; but Colville was under
certain military influences which they
could not quite understand.
</p>

<p>
Thus he wrote to Mary, stating that,
when once the Embassy was fairly established,
he would lose no time in returning
home.
</p>

<p>
'Does he not know how I am yearning
for him,' thought the girl in her heart.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
LOST.
</h3>

<p>
Damped and disconcerted by the sudden
hopelessness of his regard for Mary
Wellwood on learning that she was betrothed
to another, the young baron&mdash;after leaving
cards subsequent to the night of the
ball&mdash;did not visit the villa so frequently as
had been his wont; but the society there
was so pleasant and attractive, that he
began to drop in during the afternoons and
evenings for a little music and singing,
in both of which, like most foreigners, he
could bear his part very well.
</p>

<p>
That Ellinor had undergone some
grief&mdash;he knew not precisely what it
was&mdash;he was perfectly aware, but her story
was not one on which Mrs. Deroubigne
cared to enlighten him fully.  He could
also see that she wore black or sombre
dresses, with suites of jet ornaments, for
Ellinor felt that to do so was at least all
that she might indulge in, as a proper
tribute to the memory of one who had
loved her well.
</p>

<p>
The sisters were to have been photographed
in their sixteenth century ball
costumes for the delectation of Colville;
but this frivolity they abandoned after
hearing of Robert Wodrow's catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor often recalled the night of that
brilliant festivity, when she had waltzed
and promenaded to and fro as one in a
dream of delight, and spoke in a hushed
tone as if she feared to waken from it to a
real and commonplace life, for never before
had she been in so gay and glittering a
paradise; but now that was all over&mdash;gone
like a dissolving view, and she could but
think of the poor heart that had loved her
so well and so fondly now lying cold
and stiff in the waters of the Cabul
river.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deroubigne knew of Robert Wodrow
only by name.  Thus her natural
equanimity on the subject of his fate,
combined with her social qualities and
equally natural brightness, helped much
to calm, even to soothe, the equally natural
grief, and also perhaps the remorse of
Ellinor, who, of course, became in time
composed and consoled over the inevitable,
though she was still too terrified or too
much pained to write to his parents&mdash;a
task which she relegated to Mary.
</p>

<p>
And in her quiet and subdued grief, most
generous, unvaryingly kind and sympathetic
was young Rolandsburg, though he
knew not quite the cause from which it
sprang; and charmed by her sadness,
softness, and beauty, finding that the elder
sister was lost to him, it seemed to
Mrs. Deroubigne that he was already turning
his attention to the younger.
</p>

<p>
Ellinor had&mdash;as she said to Mary&mdash;wept
her eyes out for poor Bob Wodrow;
and thus, after a time, the elasticity of her
volatile nature began to reassert itself, to
the delight of the baron.
</p>

<p>
Nature, we are told, abhors a vacuum; so
did the heart of the handsome young
Uhlan; hence he adopted a new <i>rôle</i> in
his bearing to Ellinor, all the more easily
and all the more readily that he had not
committed himself with Mary.
</p>

<p>
Blooming as the German girls are,
Ellinor's softer beauty was a new experience
to him; she was like a tea-rose, a sea-shell,
a wonderfully delicate and tinted bit
of feminine nature, and as before, he first
made Mrs. Deroubigne his confidant.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, madame!' said he, clasping his
hands melodramatically, while drooping his
head on one side till it nearly touched his
gilt shoulderstrap, 'I suppose she could
not understand anyone dying of love&mdash;of
love of her?'
</p>

<p>
'I think not,' replied Mrs. Deroubigne,
laughing excessively at this leading remark
when remembering that he had been in the
mood of 'dying for love' of Mary but some weeks before.
</p>

<p>
Yet he was a pleasant, handsome fellow,
with so much <i>bonhommie</i> about him that it
was impossible not to be pleased with him,
all the more that the iron cross on his
breast showed that he had comported
himself gallantly in the field.
</p>

<p>
'The Fraulein Ellinor is very cold and
very calm,' said he; 'she can take a man's
heart&mdash;take all his love and give him none in return.'
</p>

<p>
'It is not so,' replied Mrs. Deroubigne.
</p>

<p>
'How, madame, then?'
</p>

<p>
'You do not know her story; but why
should I recur to it?'
</p>

<p>
'Her story&mdash;she has had, then, an <i>affaire
du coeur</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'One at least, certainly,' said Mrs. Deroubigne,
laughing again at the baron's
expression of face and tone of pique.
</p>

<p>
'Der Teufel!  One at least?  How sad
it is to think of a young lady having a
story!  And this&mdash;or these&mdash;render her
indifferent to me?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps,' replied Mrs. Deroubigne, who,
much as she liked the young Prussian, did
not wish to flatter his hopes, but he was
not the less resolved to put the matter to
the issue.
</p>

<p>
Calling one afternoon when Mrs. Deroubigne
and Mary had driven into Hamburg,
he intercepted Ellinor in the garden, with
her little camp-stool, easel, and colour-box,
about to go forth and sketch; and though
he had but a few minutes to spare, as his
horse was at the gate to take him back to
barracks, he resolved to utilise them.
</p>

<p>
Shaded from the declining sun by a
broad garden-hat, he thought Ellinor's
face never looked so charming before.
Her eyes were peculiarly her greatest
beauty; they were of the clearest and
most luminous hazel&mdash;not very dark, and
sweetly trustful and straightforward in
expression; but they drooped now and
sought the flower-beds, for something she
read in those of young Rolandsburg told
her what was coming.
</p>

<p>
In the physical nature of some people
who love keenly there is a mysterious
sympathy that draws them together, and
the baron, thinking that she was inspired
by that now, put out his hand to touch
hers, but she withdrew it.
</p>

<p>
This was not encouraging, but he drew
nearer her half-averted ear, and whispered
bluntly enough, but tremulously, nevertheless,
</p>

<p>
'This is a great joy finding you
alone&mdash;alone, that I may tell you what I have
been longing&mdash;dying to tell you for weeks
past&mdash;that I love you, Ellinor, and you
only!'
</p>

<p>
In his foreign accent and half-broken
English, the avowal sounded very pretty
and simple, but did not touch Ellinor
much, though she trembled and grew pale,
for no woman can have such things said
to her and remain quite unmoved.
</p>

<p>
'Love <i>me</i>&mdash;how strange!' said she,
scarcely knowing what to say.
</p>

<p>
'To you it may seem so,' he continued,
slowly and earnestly; 'for I know or
suspect that you cherish some dead&mdash;some
mysterious memory, and that you cannot
or may not care for me as I wish you to
do; but that does not prevent me from
loving you, and you may never understand,
even dimly, how much I do love
you, and I can keep this secret untold
no longer.'
</p>

<p>
'I respect you much, baron,' replied
Ellinor, for his declaration was more
formal than impetuous; 'but mere talking
to me will not make me love you in return.
I feel quite confused&mdash;most unhappy to
hear all this; and we shall have to go
away from Altona.'
</p>

<p>
'Go from Altona?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I only tell you because I can not
control&mdash;can not help myself,' said he,
humbly and sadly, and not without an
emotion of pique at the ill-luck of his second venture.
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, baron, but it cannot be,'
said Ellinor, shaking her pretty head decidedly.
</p>

<p>
'You cannot&mdash;love me.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;not as you wish.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said he, after a pause, during
which he had been eyeing her downcast
face with an expression of disappointment
and chagrin, 'be it so; but I trust you
will pardon any unpleasantness my
perhaps abrupt avowal has occasioned you;
and I also trust that in the future you
will always view me as your friend&mdash;as
one who will ever be ready and eager to
hold out the hand of a brother to you,
Miss Ellinor.  Even with that conviction
I shall be happy,' he added, with a voice
that certainly broke a little with emotion.
</p>

<p>
She now gave her hand frankly, and he
pressed it kindly, and then, proceeding to
fill with tobacco his consolatory meerschaum
pipe (that dangled at his button-hole)
prior to riding back to the Dammthor
Wall, he said, with a sigh,
</p>

<p>
'Ach&mdash;I will get over this, no doubt!'
</p>

<p>
'As you must have got over others, no
doubt,' said Ellinor, laughing now, but
piqued by his philosophy, and to see that
he could so calmly canvass the prospect of
ceasing to care for her already.  But what
does it matter?  Robert Wodrow had loved
her as no man had ever loved her, and
what had been <i>his</i> reward?
</p>

<p>
'Now leave me, please, baron,' she said,
a little bluntly; 'the tide is far out, and I
wish to sketch the creek and villa from
yonder bank of dry sand ere the sun sets.'
</p>

<p>
'I must go&mdash;for parade awaits me; but
must I recur to this dear subject no
more?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;no more,' said Ellinor, with decision,
yet with a smile nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
The baron felt that all was over when he
saw that smile; indeed, when with Ellinor,
he always felt that he was in the presence
of some feeling deeper than he could
fathom; and, bowing low, he turned sadly
away.  Then in a few minutes the clatter of
his horse's hoofs was heard as he cantered
off towards the Millernthor, and so ended
another little romance in Ellinor's life&mdash;at
least, she thought so.  And the baron
knew that now never again could they
enjoy each other's society as they had
done so innocently till that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding over the firm dry sand left
by the far retreating tide, she selected a
point upon a rough pebble-covered knoll,
a quarter of a mile from the little wooded
creek, set her sketching-block upon her
tiny easel, and, seating herself upon a
little camp-stool, proceeded, with her back
to the setting sun, to outline the creek,
with the trees, the garden, and sandy beach
in foreground, and the villa in the middle
distance.
</p>

<p>
She was very full of her work, to have
it as a souvenir of Altona, but it proceeded
very, very slowly; she was too full of the
late episode to do much with her pencil&mdash;much
successfully at least, and paused
ever and anon to sink into deep thought
over the past, the present, and the future.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Mary and Mrs. Deroubigne returned
home to a late dinner, Ellinor was
not to be seen, she was not in the villa,
and she was not in the garden, nor in
the adjacent shrubberies, so the house-bell
was rung for her in vain; and to
Mrs. Deroubigne, Ellinor, always dreamy,
delicate, and in temperament excitable, had
been somewhat of a responsibility, more
than her sister Mary.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was served up, but remained
on the table untasted, while search after
search was made without avail, and sunset
was at hand.
</p>

<p>
She had last been seen in the garden,
with Baron Rolandsburg, with her drawing
materials and apparatus, going forth to sketch.
</p>

<p>
With the baron!
</p>

<p>
'Could she have eloped with him?'
thought Mary, while her heart sank&mdash;recalling
Ellinor's former folly&mdash;the folly
she had been on the brink of committing
with Sir Redmond Sleath.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that was very unlikely!  Ellinor
was a changed girl, and less confiding,
and the young baron was too confident
in himself, his position, wealth, and
resources to love mystery or mischief when
neither were needed.
</p>

<p>
A presentiment of evil&mdash;an emotion that
she could not have explained&mdash;came over
Mary's mind.  Vainly she sought to settle
her thoughts to some fixity of purpose.
A vague terror seized her, and she could
scarcely even think.
</p>

<p>
She remembered when Ellinor was ill
how the tolling of the Passing Bell in the
adjacent church appalled her with the
dread that she was about to lose her&mdash;her
only relation in the world; and had
she lost her now?
</p>

<p>
'Was she going far to sketch?' Mrs. Deroubigne
suddenly inquired of her now
scared domestics.
</p>

<p>
'No, madame!  Only to the sands beside
the river, when the tide was out.'
</p>

<p>
'The tide!' exclaimed Mrs. Deroubigne;
and, accompanied by Mary, she rushed to
the foot of the garden, to find the creek
full and the Elbe at flood tide and more.
</p>

<p>
'My God&mdash;oh, what can have happened?'
exclaimed Mrs. Deroubigne, who
was aware of a periodical event of which
Mary knew nothing.
</p>

<p>
It was this.  When the wind is from
the west, and especially if violent, the
waters of the Elbe become swollen to such
a degree that the canals of Hamburg
overflow their banks, the cellars, magazines
and all channels, become gorged and
inundated&mdash;that, in fact, the tide suddenly
rises, sometimes to the height of twenty
feet, with a rapidity that is alike
dangerous and terrible.  So the gorged tide,
swollen by the incoming waves of the
German Sea, was rolling inshore now, and
Ellinor had been on the sands&mdash;the
temporary dry sands, to sketch!
</p>

<p>
A wild waste of water was rolling and
boiling there now, and where was she?
</p>

<p>
'Ellinor&mdash;oh, Ellinor!' cried Mary, again
and again, in a voice of agony; but, save
the sough of the waves, there was no
response.
</p>

<p>
Soaked to pulp her sketch-book was
found at the foot of the creek washed
inshore, and, if other evidence of a tragedy
was wanting, something was seen floating
in the oozy waves about ten yards
distant.
</p>

<p>
Jack, the terrier&mdash;that dog which had
such amazing facility for getting into
canine troubles&mdash;sprang in, and yapping
and yelping laid that something at the feet
of his mistress, who recognised at once her
sister's garden-hat; and a low cry of
despair escaped Mary as she turned it over
in her trembling hands, and painfully and
vividly it brought before her the face,
figure, and whole individuality of the lost
one.
</p>

<p>
A torrent of tears escaped Mrs. Deroubigne,
but Mary seemed to have lost the
power to shed one.
</p>

<p>
Even as the angry waves came rolling
into the creek, so did wave after wave of
sorrow seem to be coming upon her again,
dark and sharp as ever.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Lord&mdash;how long&mdash;how long!' she
wailed in her heart.
</p>

<p>
She stretched out her hands as if
clutching the air for support, she swayed
a little, and then, her strength failing her,
she would have fallen on her pallid face
had not Mrs. Deroubigne caught her fast
in her motherly arms.
</p>

<p>
Night drew on and day came again without
a trace of the lost one, dead or alive.
</p>

<p>
Baron Rolandsburg, who was appalled
by a catastrophe so sudden and unforeseen,
corroborated the story that she had gone
on the stretch of dry sand to sketch, and
no doubt remained till the sudden tide
had overtaken and overwhelmed her!
</p>

<p>
He now made himself invaluable in his
exertions for intelligence.  Rewards were
offered to boatmen and river-pilots, and in
the <i>Hamburger Nachrichten</i> and other
journals 'for her remains' (how horrible did
this sound), but unknown to Mary, who
was for several days and nights all but
unconscious.  He also put himself into
communication with their <i>Herrshaften</i>
(their Excellencies) the four Burgomasters
and four Syndics, and the Gendermerie,
but all in vain.
</p>

<p>
Other traces of Ellinor than those which
the hungry waves had washed to Mary's
feet were never found!
</p>

<p>
The latter was now a prey to two emotions,
when a time came that she could consider
calmly.  One was an intense longing to
get away from Altona as a place which
had now become hateful to her, as the
scene of so much sadness; and the other
was an affectionate repugnance to leave it,
until her sister's fate was made certain,
and her remains found.
</p>

<p>
But the latter might have been washed
out to sea, and never&mdash;never might be
heard of more.
</p>

<p>
The inexorable had to be accepted, but
we fear that poor Mary Wellwood could
not do so with the calmness of a disciple
of Epictitus, the stoic.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
THE SEQUEL.
</h3>

<p>
Ellinor's sketching, as we have said, did
not progress much.
</p>

<p>
She was full of thoughts, yet none of
pride, of flattered vanity, or exultation
were in her mind, but a dull and curious
sense of fear and shame&mdash;a vague
consciousness of doubt and wrong.
</p>

<p>
Could it be that she&mdash;unwittingly&mdash;had
in any way given encouragement to this
young baron, or done aught that led up to
the sudden declaration he had made?
</p>

<p>
She could not tax herself with having
done so.  She liked him very much&mdash;who
would not that knew him?&mdash;he was so
suave, so gentle, and so manly.  But love,
no&mdash;she had no heart for him; and how
were they to meet now, after this?
</p>

<p>
She felt as if suddenly wakened from a
dream; but a more terrible awakening was
soon to come upon her.
</p>

<p>
'Nonsense!' she thought; 'this silly
young officer must evidently love or flirt
with some one.  Latterly it was Mary,
now it is Ellinor.'
</p>

<p>
The Baron Rolandsburg was&mdash;as Sleath
had been in her eyes apparently&mdash;the
possessor of all she had wished for, and
learned to worship&mdash;position, rank, riches,
and luxury; but neither could love her as
poor Bob had done!  And now Ellinor
was&mdash;when too late for the sake of the
latter&mdash;changed from a somewhat selfish
and frivolous girl into a woman of thought,
and one capable of much endurance and
self-sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
Through Sir Redmond Sleath her pride
had received a severe shock; she had long
since come to loathe the very idea of him;
as for his name, it never escaped Mary or
Mrs. Deroubigne, and her soul sickened
when she thought of all she had sacrificed
for his unworthy sake, and of the horrible
pitfall he had prepared for her.
</p>

<p>
But why recall these things now, she
thought, as she resumed her pencil.
</p>

<p>
The deep red tints of the golden sun,
setting amid fiery haze beyond the Elbe
and the tiny hills of Hanover, lay in all
their richness on the creek, on the villa
and its flowers and shrubs: on Altona in
the background, with all its rows of
poplars and pointed roofs; and Ellinor often
paused in her work, and, wooed by the
lap, lap, lapping and murmur of the tide,
sank into a kind of dream.
</p>

<p>
The present fled&mdash;the past returned.
</p>

<p>
She no longer saw the rows of lofty
poplars, the long <i>Palmaille</i>, and the great
church of Altona, or the house on the hill
where Dumourier dwelt.  She was back in
the old summer garden of Birkwoodbrae,
with the fragrance of its roses and
honeysuckle around her; she heard the familiar
hoot of Mary's pet owl&mdash;the owl that
Robert Wodrow had risked his life to
secure; she heard again the murmur of the
May and the song of the thrush mingling
with the rustle of the silver birches that
shadowed the roof under which her parents
died.
</p>

<p>
So, lulled by the beauty of the evening,
by the warmth of the sunshine, and the
murmuring wavelets of the glorious river,
she dropped asleep.
</p>

<p>
She could not have sat thus above
twenty minutes when she was suddenly
awakened by the flow of water over her
ankles, and, starting up, found herself
surrounded by water&mdash;water on all sides,
and water between her and the shore,
which was nearly a quarter of a mile
distant, but seemed to be much further off,
the once dry sands being now covered by
the incoming flood-tide&mdash;a tide that flowed
with exceeding violence and fury.
</p>

<p>
A half-stifled shriek escaped her, and
she started to her feet.  Her easel had been
swept away; she attempted to run
shorewards; but as the water deepened and
rose to her knees she uttered a despairing
cry, and rushed back to the sandy knoll
on which she had planted her chair, and
over which the encroaching water was
rising and deepening with every inward
flow of the waves.
</p>

<p>
She was lost!
</p>

<p>
From the beach (that seemed now so
awfully distant) not a soul seemed to
observe her terrible predicament.
</p>

<p>
From being shrill and continuous, her
despairing shrieks became hoarse and faint,
and, worse than all, the wind seemed to
sweep them seaward.  Wild and black
despair, with the terror of immediate
death, filled her heart.  What terrible
retribution was this?  Was she to perish
by drowning&mdash;to die the same death that
Robert Wodrow had died&mdash;to perish and
leave poor Mary alone in the world&mdash;all
alone!
</p>

<p>
She parted the rich brown hair from
her brow, and, casting her eyes upward
to the flushed evening sky, prayed for
strength to die, and for submission to the
will of heaven; and, even as she prayed, a
wave that rolled nearly to her knees made
her stagger.  The sandy knoll was
completely covered, and the water was rising
fast.
</p>

<p>
A very few minutes more and she would
be swept off her feet, to sink and drown!
Across the waters of the broad river, the
red sun, now level with them and the flat
horizon, shed his dazzling rays into her
eyes, that were becoming half-blinded by
the rising spoon drift torn from the waves
by the storm.
</p>

<p>
It all seemed an unreality&mdash;a horrid
nightmare.
</p>

<p>
She heard, or imagined she heard, a cry
of encouragement&mdash;of coming succour;
but, blinded by terror and despair, she
knew not whence it came, whether from
the land or the water.
</p>

<p>
A numbness seemed to creep fast over
her&mdash;a sensation, or rather the want of it,
that threatened speedily to paralyse alike
thought and feeling.
</p>

<p>
Human endurance, in the weak and
delicate form of the girl, could stand no
more; an incoming wave, stronger than
the rest, struck her above the waist, and
she fell backwards into the water, and, as
the latter rose over her head, her senses
left her, and darkness closed around her.
</p>

<p>
Anon she breathed again, and the light
flashed into her eyes.  She found herself
in a boat, encircled by the strong and
protecting arm of a man, and closed her
eyes with an invocation to heaven,
believing that she was being rowed shoreward,
for she could hear the regular dash
of the oar-blades, and the hard breathing
of those who pulled them; but she
remained passive and voiceless, with closed
eyes, incapable of volition, almost of
thought, and certainly of speech.
</p>

<p>
After a brief space the boat jarred
against something.  It was the side of a
vessel, and she felt herself lifted
upward&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;and placed in the arms of a
man, whose exclamation gave her a species
of electric shock.
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of Sir Redmond Sleath,
and it was his astonished and certainly
bewildered face that she found close to
her own when she opened her eyes, only
to shut them once more, as weakness and
horror took away her senses again.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE HAKIM ABOU AYOUB.
</h3>

<p>
'I am on the eve of departing with Sir
Louis Cavagnari to Cabul,' Colville had
written.  'With his mission the chances
of future war are over, and then I can
come home with honour&mdash;home to you,
love Mary.'
</p>

<p>
But while the British troops were now
retiring from every point within the new
frontier, Colville, to whom activity or
action of any kind was a species of relief
till he could once again see her whose
varying expression of feature defied alike
artist or photographer to fix or do justice
to, gladly undertook to convey to the
viceroy at Simla that letter from the
Ameer which brought the embassy into
existence&mdash;the embassy which was
doomed to have such a fatal end&mdash;and a
portion of that fulsome, false, and deluding
document ran as follows, after the usual
solemn invocation which preludes every
chapter of the Koran, and the words of
which, when sent down from Heaven,
caused, says Giaab, the clouds to fly
eastward, the winds to lull, the sea to moan,
all the animals of the earth to erect their
ears and listen, while the devils fell
headlong from the celestial spheres:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Be it known unto your High Excellency
that since the day of my arrival in
Cabul from the British camp at Gundamuck
I have been happy and pleased with
the reception accorded me by the British
officers.  I had resolved to visit Simla and
give myself the boundless pleasure of a
joyous interview with your Excellency, for
the purpose of strengthening our friendly
relations, but circumstances prevented me
carrying my intention into effect...
After completing my tour through the
country, during which I shall inspect the
frontiers, I intend, God willing, to have a
joyful meeting with your Excellency, for
the purpose of making firmer the basis
of our friendship and drawing closer the
bonds of our amity and affection.
</p>

<p>
'Further, what can I write, beyond
expressions of friendship?'
</p>

<p>
So, encouraged by this letter, which was
framed in the genuine Oriental spirit of
fraud and treachery, a brilliant embassy
was arranged.
</p>

<p>
After delivering to the viceroy, the
letter with which he had been entrusted
at head-quarters, Leslie Colville lingered
for a few days at beautiful Simla, where
the Court Sanatorium is in a deep and
woody dell, called&mdash;doubtless by some
old Scottish officer&mdash;Annandale, where the
forests are thickly inhabited by grinning
baboons, having white bodies with black
hands and feet, and where a savage tribe,
named the Puharries, dwell among the
hills, some of which are so vast&mdash;though
mere vassals of the Himalayas&mdash;as to seem
like the barriers of the world on the left
bank of the Indus, from which they slope
down to the steppes of Tartary, the deserts
of Gobi, and the marshes of Siberia; and
then he hastened again to the front to
join Cavagnari.
</p>

<p>
The embassy and escort, the fate of
which will never be forgotten in the
history of British India, consisted of
seventy-six men of the brilliant Guide Corps,
twenty-six of whom were troopers, the
rest infantry, under Lieutenant Hamilton,
V.C.  Their uniform was drab colour,
piped and faced with scarlet.  The
ambassador was accompanied also by a staff
of medical and other officers, including
his secretary, Mr. William Jenkyns, of the
Punjaub Civil Service.
</p>

<p>
All set out on their perilous though
apparently peaceful mission in high glee,
while the master spirit of the whole was
Major Sir Louis Cavagnari, then in his
thirty-seventh year, a gallant officer who had
served with the Bengal Europeans in the
Oude campaign, was present at the
capture of a brigade of guns at Shahelutgunge,
and served with the Kohat column
at the capture and destruction of Gara.
</p>

<p>
He was popular personally with the
natives, as he could speak several of their
languages with fluency, while his bronzed
features and dark hair enabled him to
assume when he chose, any Oriental
costume with facility, and thus he was
invaluable in all cases where courage,
promptitude, and adroit demeanour were
necessary.
</p>

<p>
All our columns having, as stated, fallen
back, the only British troops now beyond
the new frontier of Afghanistan were his
slender escort, with which he left Ali
Musjid on the 17th of June, and rode through
the savage defiles of the Khyber Pass by
Lalpura, Chardeh, and once more in sight
of Jellalabad, pursuing the course and
bank of the Cabul river.
</p>

<p>
They had now traversed about sixty
miles of their journey amid some of the
most stupendous scenery in the world,
and the evening of the second day's march
was closing in when, near the Surkab, a
stream which joins the Cabul at the foot
of the Siah Koh, a man was seen gesticulating
violently and making signs to them,
on which the whole party halted in
obedience to command.
</p>

<p>
Was he the harbinger of danger, the
announcer of an ambush; had armed <i>sungahs</i>
been formed across the path, or what?
</p>

<p>
Carbines were unslung, revolver cases
opened, sword-blades loosened in the
sheath, and there were whispers of treachery
on every hand, and every man's face
darkened, and his brows were knit, in
anticipation of a barbarous struggle and having
to sell his life dearly, for they were all
picked and tried soldiers, second to none
in Her Majesty's Indian army for daring
and discipline.  All were splendid
horsemen too&mdash;the mounted guides&mdash;and, like
their infantry, picturesque-looking fellows
in their uniform and bearing.
</p>

<p>
'The man is not an Afghan, but a European,
so far as one can judge by his face,'
said Colville, who, with his bridle reins
dropped on his holsters, had been using
his field-glasses intently.
</p>

<p>
'He wears a scarlet <i>loonjee</i>,' said another
officer, 'and his dress seems a uniform.
Strange, is it not?'
</p>

<p>
'By heaven, he is one of the 10th
Hussars!' exclaimed Colville.
</p>

<p>
'What is he doing here?  His regiment
fell back with the rest of the army
weeks&mdash;yes, two months&mdash;ago.  Can he be a
deserter?' suggested Hamilton.
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely, when making for us in this
frantic fashion,' replied Colville.
</p>

<p>
He came close up to the party, and,
halting within ten paces, saluted.  Then
all could see that he was a hussar, but
wan, pale, bearded, and with his braided
uniform sorely worn and tattered.
</p>

<p>
'Come on, my man,' cried Sir Louis
Cavagnari; 'come on and tell us how you
happen to be here?'
</p>

<p>
'I am here through God's mercy, sir,'
replied the hussar, coming forward, adding,
'Captain Colville&mdash;Captain Colville, don't
you know me?'
</p>

<p>
'Robert Wodrow&mdash;Heavens above!'
exclaimed the latter, holding out his hand,
which the former grasped warmly and
energetically; 'so you did not perish in
the river?'
</p>

<p>
'It was a pretty close shave, sir,&mdash;I shall
never be nearer death again, but once,'
replied Wodrow, who seemed so faint that
he could scarcely stand, and received with
gratitude a pull from an officer's brandy flask.
</p>

<p>
'Have you been a prisoner?' asked Cavagnari.
</p>

<p>
'No, sir&mdash;I was long ill in the hands of
the enemy, and was well treated.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you were not escaping?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir&mdash;but making my way to your
party when I saw it on the march, and I
blessed God when I first heard of it, for I
was told that the whole army had fallen
back, and that I&mdash;alone&mdash;was left behind.'
</p>

<p>
'You are one of the Hussars who were
swept away at the ford?' queried an officer,
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, and my story is rather a long one.'
</p>

<p>
'We shall hear it in a few minutes,' said
Sir Louis, and, riding on slowly, the party
reached the village of Balabagh, where it
halted for the night, and where the party
found quarters.
</p>

<p>
The story of Robert Wodrow, who was
full of joy to find himself among comrades
again, was a very simple one, and, though
made in the form of a species of report or
explanation to Sir Louis Cavagnari as the
senior officer present, was principally
directed to Leslie Colville, whom, of course,
he viewed as a friend, and from whom he
heard, with no small dismay, of the actual
extent of the catastrophe to the squadron.
</p>

<p>
Though kicked more than once by his
own charger after he fell into the stream,
he had, after a time, got his feet free from
the stirrups; but was swept away like a
cork by the current after he had passed
through the rapids.  Being a good
swimmer, he contrived to keep his head above
water, but was incapable of reaching the
banks, as they were steep, rocky, and in
many places rose sheer like walls from the
bed of the Cabul.  Thus he was borne for
nearly three miles below the point where
so many of his comrades perished; and,
feeling that he could struggle with fate no
more, was about to relinquish further
effort when suddenly voices caught his
ear; he saw some strange white figures
near the bank of the river&mdash;figures like
those of witches or spectres as seen by
the radiance of the stars (as the moon was
under a cloud now), and by some strange
and lambent lights that were floating
on the surface of the water, and in the
very midst of which he suddenly found
himself, but with a current which shallowed
so fast that he could make good his
footing.
</p>

<p>
Among the Mahomedans and Hindoos
there is a pretty custom&mdash;which the former
have no doubt borrowed from the latter,
as they both practise it&mdash;of going to a
river or tank after the fulfilment of a vow,
and setting afloat, as an offering, small,
saucer-like lamps of earthenware, each
containing oil, with a lighted wick.
</p>

<p>
After having said the <i>fatihar</i>, or necessary
prayers, they watch their votive lamps
as they float down the stream, and girls
often augur their success in love by the
steadiness of the journeying down the
darkening waters.
</p>

<p>
There are certain seasons of the year,
such as the Shabibarat feast in the month
of Shaban, when this ceremony is carried
out on a vast and beautiful scale.
</p>

<p>
It was a fleet of votive lamps amid
which Robert Wodrow now found himself,
and for a moment or two he had a striking
view of some groups of Indian girls clad
in white floating drapery, their long black
hair unbound, their arms bare to the
elbow, their other limbs to the knee, half
lost in shadow and half seen in light, upon
the steps of a Temple-ghaut&mdash;we say for a
moment or two only, as on beholding him
rising, as it were, from the water, they fled
with shrill cries of affright.
</p>

<p>
Worn and faint, and heedless of what
became of him, he reached the marble
steps of the ghaut, and lay there for a
time oblivious of everything.
</p>

<p>
When he recovered a little, though
well-nigh dead with cold and exhaustion, he
could see by the light of the moon, which
now shone out clearly, a tall, thin, and
venerable-looking Afghan bending over him.
</p>

<p>
His ample beard was snowy white, his
eyes were keen and glittering, his features
were of the Jewish type peculiar to the
country, while his costume was that of the
primitive Afghan&mdash;wide pantaloons of blue
stuff, a brown camise with flowing sleeves,
and a black fur cap.
</p>

<p>
Putting a hand on Wodrow's head, he
told him in Afghani&mdash;which is the Pushtu
language spoken by all the Afghans, and
the origin of which is unknown&mdash;to take
courage, as he would protect him; and
Robert Wodrow, having picked up a little
Sanscrit from his father, the old minister,
made a shift to understand him, and knew
also that he quoted the fourth chapter of
the Koran, which recommends charity and
protection to all helpless strangers.
</p>

<p>
And between cold and exhaustion, added
to more than one kick from his horse, poor
Wodrow was helpless indeed, but he had
fortunately fallen into excellent hands&mdash;those
of Abou Ayoub, a good, pious, and
intelligent hakim, or physician of the adjacent
village, the inhabitants of which were friendly
to the British, or to anyone who would
protect them from the Afreedies on the one
hand and the Khyberees of the Suffaidh
Koh on the other, and for defence against
these the village, which consisted of a
mosque, a tank, and some sixty houses,
was surrounded by a strong wall pierced
with double rows of loopholes for musketry.
</p>

<p>
He conveyed him to his house, and
there on a <i>charpoy</i>, or native truckle bed,
Robert Wodrow lay for days and weeks in
fever and delirium, attended by the hakim
and his three daughters and a Belooch
slave.  The former had skill enough to
dose his patient with ipecacuanha, with
infusions of manna, and food, including
rice, tamarinds, and stewed prunes; but he
and they believed much more in sentences
of the Koran, written on paper, and washed
off into the drink he imbibed, which was
generally cool tamarind sherbet, that
proved in times of feverish thirst a delicious
draught, especially from the hands of
Ayesha, the eldest and prettiest daughter
of the three.
</p>

<p>
Among the Afghans women are not
secluded from all male society, as they are
strictly in other Mahommedan communities,
for the women of the middle and
lower orders share in all the domestic
amusements of their husbands, who
generally content themselves with one wife,
and in the country the latter is unveiled.
</p>

<p>
Young unmarried women are distinguished
by wearing their hair loose and by
their trousers being white.  Thus Ayesha
and her two sisters wore their long black
hair loose, but interwoven with gold chains
and strings of Venetian sequins.  And the
hakim, who never omitted an opportunity
of quoting the Koran, duly informed
Robert Wodrow that she was so named
from Ayesha&mdash;one of the four perfect
women, and a wife of Mahomet the
Prophet&mdash;a lady who had a very terrible
adventure in the sixth year of the Hejira.
</p>

<p>
After a few weeks of their care, Robert
became convalescent.  He was young,
courageous, and buoyant with hope; he
felt a trust in his own resources and
exertions, and, encouraged by the praise he
had won from Colville and other officers,
had begun to take a new interest in life&mdash;to
have some hope for the future, and a
desire to grapple with any difficulties and
dangers that lay before him; but certainly
he felt something akin to consternation
when informed by the hakim that the
Treaty of Gundamuck had been signed;
that Great Britain had made peace with
the Ameer; that all our troops had retired
towards the Indus, and that he himself
was left behind among the wild mountains
by the Surkhab, some seventy miles from
the frontier&mdash;a distance which he could
scarcely hope to traverse alone on foot in
safety, amid such perilous surroundings.
</p>

<p>
'Death cometh to everyone&mdash;even though
he be in a lofty tower, saith the Koran,
but your time, Feringhee, is not come yet,'
said the Hakim Abou Ayoub to his guest,
while smiling at the scared expression of
his face.
</p>

<p>
The house of Abou Ayoub was a low but
comfortable-looking building, surrounded
by groves of tall palm-trees; it had a flat
roof and a verandah, where Robert and the
Hakim sat at times in the evening smoking,
talking of the time when the former
must make an effort to get away, or
listening to the girls playing the saringa, or
native guitar, and singing monotonously
the odes of Rebman, the Khan of the
Khutticks.
</p>

<p>
In this verandah the Hakim received
his poor patients, who gazed with wonder
and awe when the door of his sanctum
or surgery was open, though therein were
only a few boxes of books and drugs&mdash;a
great vase of rose-water, and a three-lipped
brass lamp suspended from a tall iron
rod&mdash;for with them the science of healing
was associated with something of sorcery
and witchcraft.  Robert Wodrow, with
all the Hakim's kindness, wearied of the
routine of the daily life there&mdash;the
perpetual prayers and ablutions of his host.
At each meal the old man always poured
water into a brass basin, in which Robert
had to dip his hands ere he could plunge
them into the pilao, which Ayesha had
prepared; though, sooth to say, the
Hakim, after uttering the invariable
Bismillah, usually had his fingers in first,
selecting the most delicate morsels for his
guest, as knives and forks are unknown
in the land of Baber.  Then would come
little cups of savoury curries, chutnees,
and sweetmeats; and, when evening fell,
ablutions again; a white cloth was spread
over the carpet, and, turning his bowed
face in the direction of Mecca, old Abou
Ayoub devoutly said his prayers for the
night.
</p>

<p>
There is a language of the eye, and a
freemasonry when hand touches hand that
all women know or learn; and ere long
Robert Wodrow discovered, to his alarm,
that the eldest daughter of his host had
eyes for him alone&mdash;we say to his alarm,
for, if he did not respond, her heart might
grow revengeful.
</p>

<p>
This made his situation perilous amid
society so strange, and more intently did
he long to be gone, though the girl was,
in her own way, very pretty, very fair
for an Afghan, and coquettishly wore the
brightest coloured camises, embroidered
vests, and laced trousers of the finest
muslin to attract him,
</p>

<p>
When the Hakim was absent, there was
no mistaking her languishing demeanour,
which sorely perplexed the hussar.
</p>

<p>
If she loved him, as he doubted not, he
at least did not know how to fall in love
again, and to what end could it be with
<i>her</i>?
</p>

<p>
Too intensely had he passed through
the passion not to know how it was crushed
out of him by the agony of loss; and
he had but one desire, to get well and
strong, and at all risks evade this new
peril.
</p>

<p>
One morning the Hakim came to him
with a face expressive of excitement and
pleasure; it was to announce that a
<i>tchopper</i>, or Cabulee mounted courier, had
ridden through the adjacent pass and seen
British troops marching north-westward
from Jellalabad.
</p>

<p>
'British troops!' exclaimed Wodrow,
starting up, and at the moment in haste to
be gone.
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah, not so fast, my son,' said the
Hakim; 'you must have food ere you go.'
</p>

<p>
In haste Ayesha prepared for him a
<i>kafta kawab</i>, or dish of savoury meat balls,
with her own hands, and, unseen by Wodrow,
her tears dropped into the pipkin as
she did so; but he could scarcely eat of it,
he was in such haste to be gone.
</p>

<p>
From the loopholes in the village wall
the Hakim showed him the gleam of arms
as a party of troops came defiling into the
narrow valley, through which the Surk-ab
flows to the Cabul river, and then they
wrung each other's hands in farewell.
</p>

<p>
'Peace be upon you!' cried Wodrow,
who knew enough of the language to say this.
</p>

<p>
'And likewise on you be peace and the
mercy of God!' cried the Hakim, in his
sonorous Afghani, and another moment
saw Robert Wodrow hurrying down the
hillside, and leaving the walled killa, or
village, fast behind him.
</p>

<p>
'Things in this world wag strangely,' said
Robert Wodrow to Colville, and forgetting
that others heard him.  'As you may know,
I didn't care to live; but I pulled
through&mdash;pulled through when those with a happier
future and more hope might have succumbed.'
</p>

<p>
What followed has already been narrated.
</p>

<p>
'After the kindness of that old Hakim
to me, I shall ever think well of these
Afghan fellows in future,' said Robert.
</p>

<p>
'Quite right too, Wodrow,' responded
Leslie Colville; 'but we have yet to see
how we get on with them at Cabul.'
</p>

<p>
He had his doubts, and, curiously
enough, they were prophetic.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of genuine thankfulness,
Robert Wodrow accepted a few cigars
from the proffered case of young Hamilton,
of the Guides (a gallant fellow who had
already won the V.C.), as luxuries he had
not known for many a day.
</p>

<p>
'And now for the march towards Cabul&mdash;nearly
eighty miles from the village of
Balabagh.  As I have a spare horse, you
shall ride him, Wodrow,' said Colville.
</p>

<p>
'I shall never forget your kindness, sir.'
</p>

<p>
This was all Robert Wodrow said, but
his heart was very full, for Colville's
manner and bearing to him were kind and
considerate in the extreme; and he knew
that&mdash;the latter's generosity of nature
apart&mdash;much of this sprang from their
mutual regard for Mary and Ellinor Wellwood.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
AT CABUL.
</h3>

<p>
For Robert Wodrow to attempt to make
his way alone to where his regiment was
now quartered far in the rear, through
passes filled by savage tribes, was not to
be thought of; thus nothing was left for
him but to proceed with the ambassadors'
escort to Cabul.
</p>

<p>
He was safe now, and had escaped from
that terrible catastrophe at the Ford of
Isaac; but poor Robert was only a corporal,
and the public papers barely recorded
the circumstance.  Now he was once more
with Europeans; his whole bearing rapidly
changed; his weakness and illness seemed
to leave him, his step resumed its buoyancy,
his eyes their fire and, if sad, old
devil-may-care expression.
</p>

<p>
Though Robert Wodrow, by enlisting in
the hussars, had opened a considerable
social gulf between himself and Captain
Leslie Colville of the Guards, it was
impossible for them both not to have many
sympathies in common; thus oblivious of
that gulf the two rode frequently together,
talking of the Wellwoods and the Birks of
Invermay, on the route by Gundamuck,
Suffaidh Sang, and Hazardaracht.
</p>

<p>
On service the bonds of rank and even
of discipline, so to say, are often loosened,
for the experience of fighting side by side
makes the finest qualities of the soldier,
forming the true and loving link between
the officer and his men.  It fires the sense
of <i>esprit-de-corps</i>, and blots out all the
ignobler phases of garrison and barrack
life, teaches self-reliance, inspires
<i>cameraderie</i> and patriotism, and makes men
less coarse in speech and kindlier to each
other in spirit, and more grave and earnest
with the work in hand.
</p>

<p>
After halting for the night near
Hazardaracht, or the 'Place of the Thousand
Trees,' Sir Louis Cavagnari and his party
pushed upwards to the famous Shutargardan
Pass, which is eleven thousand
five hundred feet in height, and from
thence the road to Cabul lies through
narrow and rock-bound denies.
</p>

<p>
Immediately below this mighty mountain
eminence lie lesser hills that diminish
in height as they slope down into a vast
plain in the richest state of cultivation,
dotted by numberless villages, all of the
most picturesque aspect.
</p>

<p>
At Shutargardan the embassy found
themselves in the land of the powerful
and most warlike Ghilzie tribe, whose
fighting force was estimated at nearly two
hundred thousand men; but there they
were received with every outward honour
by an escort of the Ameer's regular troops,
whose equipment caused some surprise
and even merriment among the Europeans
of the escort.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, Colville, here are some
countrymen of yours!' cried a staff officer,
choking with laughter, as some of the
Ameer's 'Highlanders' presented arms.
</p>

<p>
The Ameer had actually dressed a body
of his troops in tartan kilts, in imitation
of the Gordon Highlanders, whose costume
had greatly impressed him, and these
they wore over baggy cotton breeches;
while the cavalry who accompanied them
wore the same nether garments (minus
the kilt) with red tunics, white belts, and
helmets of soft grey felt, and in addition
to tulwar and pistols, every man rode with
a whip, the wooden handle of which, when
not required, was stuck into his right boot.
</p>

<p>
They had smooth-bore carbines slung
over the right thigh, muzzle downwards.
</p>

<p>
'A precious set of dark-looking duffers
they are,' was Robert Wodrow's off-hand
comment, as he surveyed them.
</p>

<p>
Escorted by these troops, Sir Louis
Cavagnari and his companions continued
the remaining forty-five miles of the
journey to Cabul, passing Kushi and other
fortified villages, and it was not without
emotions of interest and anxiety too, that
they found themselves on the 24th of
June, entering the gates and traversing
the streets of that hitherto openly&mdash;perhaps
yet secretly&mdash;hostile capital, which
is surrounded by low, barren, and rocky
hills, but amid a plain which time and
human industry have made wondrously
fertile and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
The dark-visaged and motley crowds in
the streets&mdash;Afghans, Kuzzilbashes,
Persians, Tajiks, and Jews&mdash;scowled very
unmistakably at the Feringhees, whose
presence they did not want, whose prowess
in recent wars they feared, and whose
race and religion they loathed.
</p>

<p>
The streets through which the visitors
rode were all built of sun-dried bricks and
wood, about two storeys high, with flat
roofs, and low, square doorways, now and
then a larger one, with a mulberry-tree
overhanging a mud wall, indicating the
residence of a great man.
</p>

<p>
The city is three miles in circuit, and
is dominated by the Bala Hissar, in which
the embassy took up their quarters, a
place incapable of being defended, though
the citadel, in consequence of the ruinous
condition of its walls and ramparts.  It
has, however, a wide ditch, and stabling
for a thousand horses.
</p>

<p>
It is half-a-mile long by a quarter of a
mile broad, and presents externally a
cluster of lofty, square, embattled towers,
with its chief strength, or inner citadel,
high up on the slope of a hill.
</p>

<p>
As they entered its arched gate between
two circular towers, Colville heard a voice
amid the scowling crowds exclaim, with
uplifted hands,
</p>

<p>
'La Ilah ilia Allah?  Why does not He
shrivel them all up by a flash of lightning,
and cast them into hell for ever?'
</p>

<p>
The speaker mingled with the multitude,
but not before Colville recognised
his figure, and remembered Mahmoud
Shah, the sham hadji of Jellalabad; but
it would have been alike unwise to notice
or pursue him at that crisis.
</p>

<p>
In the Bala Hissar there were assigned
by the Ameer apartments for the use of
the ambassador and his suite and
escort&mdash;apartments having marble floors and walls
covered with arabesques, old as the days
of Tamerlane and Baber perhaps, certainly
as old as those of Nadir Shah, and for a
time the whole party were to all
appearance well received by the Sovereign and
his people; but after a little space the
former, notwithstanding his hollow
protestations and fulsome letter to the Viceroy
at Simla, grew cold and haughty, and
daily saw less and less of Sir Louis
Cavagnari, while the mobs without began to
manifest alike turbulence and insolence,
and the isolated embassy was doubtless
involved in peril.
</p>

<p>
Roving brigands infested all the roads
around the city, yet the months of July
and August passed, quietly enough, though
some Afghan troops who had marched in
from Herat used threatening language
against Sir Louis and insulted the soldiers
of his escort, on one occasion compelling
Colville and two of the guides to draw
their swords.
</p>

<p>
It has been said&mdash;but we know not upon
what authority&mdash;that Cavagnari received
distinct information that the lives of
himself and all his companions were in
imminent peril, but the letters which those
gentlemen sent to India, and those which
Mary Wellwood received at long intervals
from Colville, gave no indications of
apprehension.
</p>

<p>
Yet a stormy cloud was gathering over
the picturesque towers of the Bala Hissar.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
